We are now considering the case where we know the binding
specificity for a given transcription factor, and we are looking for
all the genes potentially regulated by this factor. We will use the
Nitrogen regulation as an example.  Response to nitrogen is mediated
by the so-called GATA-box, whose most common motif is GATAAG. An
interesting property is that a single GATA-box is insufficient to
affect the transcription. All genes effectively controlled by these
elements possess at least one group of 2 to 4 closely associated
GATA-boxes. 


<P>We will use <B>dna-pattern</B> to select all genes having 3 or more
occurrences of the GATA box in their 500 bp upstream region.

<P>
<OL>
<LI>
On the left pannel, click <B>genome-scale dna-pattern (strings)</B>.

<li>In the Sequence retrieval options, make sure that the selected
<b>organism</b> is <b>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</b>, and that <b>Sequence
type</b> is set to upstream.

<li>Specify the sequence limits <b>from</b> -500 <b>to</b> -1.

<LI>In the <B>Query pattern(s)</B> box, type</LI>

<PRE>GATAAG</PRE>

<LI>In the <B>Return </B>option, select <B>match counts</B>.</LI>

<LI>Change the <B>Threshold </B>to 3.</LI>

<LI>
Click <B>GO</B></LI>
</OL>

<P>
After a few seconds you will see a list of the genes with 3 or more
occurrences of the GATAAG pattern in their 500 bp upstream
sequence. Each ORF identifier appears as a hyperlink, which is
connected to the information on this ORF in the yeast genome
database.


<P>
You can now come back to the <a href=tutorials.html>tutorial main
page</a> and try the next tutorial.
