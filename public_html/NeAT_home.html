<p size = '4'>Since a few years, large scale biological studies
produced huge amounts of data about networks of molecular interactions
(protein interactions, gene regulation, metabolic reactions, signal
transduction). The integration of these data sets can be combined to
acquire a global view of the pieces that, altogether, contribute to
the complexity of biological processes. High-throughput data is however
notoriously noisy and incomplete, and it is important to evaluate the
quality of the different pieces of information that are taken in
consideration for building higher views of biological networks.</p>

<p>An important effort will be required to extract reliable
information from the ever-increasing ocean of high-throughput data.
This will require the utilization of powerful tools that enable us to
apply statistical analysis on large graphs. For this purpose, we
developed the <i><b>Network Analysis Tools (NeAT)</b></i>, as set of
tools performing basic operations on networks and clusters. The web
interface gives a convenient and intuitive access to the tools, and
allows you to bring your data sets through some typical analysis work
flows in order to extract the best of it. </p>

<p>In addition, people having computer skills can also use be same
tools via a <a href=web_services.html>Web services</a> interface, in
order to integrate them in automatic work-flows. </p>

<p>This website is free and open to all users.
