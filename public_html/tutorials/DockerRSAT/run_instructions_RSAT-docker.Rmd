# Introduction


This tutorial explains how to download and run a server of the software suite Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (**RSAT**) via a Docker container.


# Prerequisites

**Docker**: a working version of docker must be installed on the host system. 

**Disk space**: The host machine must contain a sufficient disk space to download the RSAT-docker image (~3Gb) and start a Docker container of approximately the same size. 

**Memory**: The host machine must have a sufficient RAM to allocate at least 1Gb to the docker container. 

**Operating systems**: Docker can run under a variety of operating systems: Unix, Mac OSX, Windows.
