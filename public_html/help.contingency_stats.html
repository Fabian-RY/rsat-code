<b>Warning</b>: the following text is the help message from the
on-line program, we still need to format it for the html form. There
are possibly some differencs in option names, but the help already
provides information about the statistics used by the program, and the
meaning of the different options.

<h3>NAME</h3>
    contingency-stats

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    This programs takes as input a contingency table, and calculates various
    matching statistics between the rows and columns. The description of
    these statistics can be found in Brohee and van Helden, 2006.

<h3>AUTHORS</h3>
    jvanheld@scmbb.ulb.ac.be

<h3>CATEGORY</h3>
    util

<h3>USAGE</h3>
    contingency-stats [-i inputfile] [-o outputfile] [-v]

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>
    A contingency table is a N*M table used to compare the contents of two
    classifications. Rows represent the clusters of the first classification
    (considered as reference), and columns the clusters of the second
    classification (query).

    Contingency tables can be generated with the program contingency-table,
    or with compare-classes (option -matrix QR).

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>
    A tab-delimited text file with one row per statistics.

<h3>STATISTICS</h3>
    <b>Sn</b>
        Sensitivity. This parameter indicates the fraction of each reference
        cluster (row) covered by its best matching query cluster (column).

        Sensitivity is calculated at the level of each cell (cell-wise Sn),
        of each row (row-wise Sn) and of the whole contingency table
        (table-wise Sn).

        <b>Cell-wise sensitivity</b>
            Sn_{i,j} = X_{i,j}/SUM_j(X_{i,j})

        <b>row-wise sensitivity</b>
            Sn_{i.} = MAX_j(Sn_{i,j})

            The row-wise sensitivity of a row is the maximal value of
            sensitivity for all the cells of this row.

        <b>table-wise sensitivity</b>
            Sn = SUM_i(Sn_{i.})/M

            The table-wise sensitivity is the average of the row-wise
            sensitivity over all the rows of the contingency table.

    <b>PPV</b>
        Positive Predictive Value. This parameter indicates the fraction of
        each query cluster (column) covered by its best matching reference
        cluster (row).

        PPV is calculated at the level of each cell (cell-wise PPV), of each
        column (column-wise PPV) and of the whole contingency table
        (table-wise PPV).

        <b>Cell-wise PPV</b>
            PPV_{i,j} = X_{i,j}/SUM_i(X_{i,j})

        <b>column-wise PPV</b>
            PPV_{.j} = MAX_i(PPV_{i,j})

            The column-wise PPV of a column is the maximal value of PPV for
            all the cells of this column.

        <b>table-wise PPV</b>
            PPV = SUM_j(PPV_{j.})/N

            The table-wise PPV is the average of the column-wise PPV over
            all the columns of the contingency table.

    <b>Acc.geom</b>
        Geometric accuracy. This reflects the tradeoff between sensitivity
        and positive predictive value, by computing the geometric accuracy
        between Sn and PPV.

        Acc.geom = sqrt(Sn*PPV)

    <b>Sep</b>
        Separation.

        The separation is defined, at the level of each cell (cell-wise
        separation) as the product between Sn and PPV.

        <b>Cell-wise separation</b>
            sep_{i,j}=Sn_{i,j}*PPV_{i,j}

        <b>Column-wise separation</b>
            Column-wise separation is defined at the level of each column,
            as the sum of separation value for all the cells of this column.

            sep_{.j} = SUM_i( sep_{i,j})

        <b>Row-wise separation</b>
            Row-wise separation is defined at the level of each row, as the
            sum of separation value for all the cells of this row.

            sep_{i.} = SUM_j(sep_{i,j})

        <b>Table-wise separation</b>
            Three table-wise statistics are computed for separation.

            average column-wise separation
                sep_c = AVG_j(sep_{.j})

            average row-wise separation
                sep_r = AVG_i(sep_{i.})

            table-wise separation
                sep = sqrt(sep_r*sep_c)

<h3>OPTIONS</h3>
    <b>-v #</b>
        Level of verbosity (detail in the warning messages during execution)

    <b>-h</b>
        Display full help message

    <b>-help</b>
        Same as -h

    <b>-i inputfile</b>
        If no input file is specified, the standard input is used. This
        allows to use the command within a pipe.

    <b>-o outputfile</b>
        If no output file is specified, the standard output is used. This
        allows to use the command within a pipe.

    <b>-decimals #</b>
        Number of decimals to display for the computed statistics.

    <b>-param param_value</b>
        Include a user-specified parameter value in the table-wise
        statistics. Can be used iteratively on the same commande line.

        This is useful when the script is used iteratively, to calculate
        statistics under various conditions (for example various parameter
        values for a clustering algorithm). The table-wise statistics can
        then be integrated in a single table with the program
        clompare-scores.

    <b>-return return_fields</b>
        List of fields to return.

        Supported fields: stats, rowstats, colstats, tables, margins

        <b>stats</b>
            table-wise statistics

        <b>rowstats</b>
            row-wise statistics (one line per row of the contingency table)

        <b>colstats</b>
            column-wise statistics (one line per column of the contingency
            table)

        <b>tables</b>
            full tables for each statistics (counts, Sn, PPV, separation).

        <b>margins</b>
            marginal statistics besides the tables (requires to return
            tables).

    <b>-rsizes row_size_file</b>
        Specify row group sizes in a separate file. This option can be used
        in particular cases where the marginal sum of the contingency table
        does not correspond to the group sizes (for example if a
        classification supoprts the same elements assigned to multiple
        groups, or on the contrary if some elements can be unassigned).

        The row size file must contain one row per row of the contingency
        table, and two columns. The first column indicated the name of the
        row (the same name as in the contingency table), and the second the
        size of the corresponding group.

    <b>-csizes column_size_file</b>
        Specify column group sizes in a separate file.

        Same description as for -rsizes.
