<UL>Let us suppose that you are searching the positions of putative GATA
boxes and Hap sites within the upstream regions of the genes from the GDH
family (GDH1, GDH2, and GDH3). We will first retrieve the sequences upstream
from your genes.

</UL>
<P>

<OL>
<OL>
<P><LI>
Retrieve upstream sequences from -800 to -1 for the following yeast
genes (as you have seen in the <a
href="tut_sequence_retrieval.html">tutorial on sequence retrieval</a>)

<PRE>
GDH1
GDH2
GDH3
</PRE>

<P>Now we have the upstream sequences, we will scan them with the consensi
for GATA boxes and HAP sites. At the top of the result page, a series of
buttons are presented. These buttons allow you to send your sequence to
a selection of sequence analysis programs. Click on <B>dna-pattern (IUPAC)</B>.
A new form appears. 

<P>
Note that the search will automatically be performed on the sequences
you just retrieved (<i>sequences transferred from your previous
query</I>). This differs from the form you would receive by clicking
on "dna-pattern" in the left panel, and which would allow to fill an
additional box with your own sequences.

<P><LI>
In the <B>Query pattern(s)</B> box, we will enter the patterns to search
for. Eah pattern must come on a separate line. The first word of each line
is the string to search for, the second word is an identifier for this
pattern. Type the following text in the Query pattern(s) box:</LI>

<PRE>GATWA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gata_box
CCAAY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hap_site</PRE>
Note the use of degenerate IUPAC degenerate code: the W from GATWA on the
first line means "either A or T", the Y from CCAAY on the second line means
"either C or T".
<P><LI>
&nbsp;click <B>GO</B>.</LI>

<P>
You see now the positions of all matches with the patterns you entered
within the upstream sequence of GDH1, GDH2 and GDH3. Each line shows a
single match, and the different columns indicate respectively:
<OL>
<P><LI>
the pattern identifier.</LI>

<P><LI>
the strand on which the match was found (W for Watson, C for Crick).</LI>

<P><LI>
the pattern searched for (i.e. the consensus you provided)</LI>

<P><LI>
the sequence in which it was found.</LI>

<P><LI>
the starting position of the match</LI>

<P><LI>
the end position of the match</LI>

<P><LI>
the matching sequence. The matching bases are indicated in UPPERCASES.
The 4 flanking bases at left and right are provided in lowercases.</LI>
</OL>

</UL>

<P>
We will now display the same results graphically.

<OL>
<P><LI>
Click on the <B>Feature map</B> button on the top of the result page.</LI>

<P><LI>
In the <B>Title </B>box, type</LI>

<PRE>Gata boxes and Hap sites in the upstream regions from GDH genes</PRE>

<P><LI>
after the title <B>Display limits</B>, fill</LI>

<UL>
<P><LI>
the <B>from </B>box with -800,</LI>

<P><LI>
the <B>to </B>box with 0</LI>
</UL>

<P><LI>
In the pop-up menu "<B>feature handle</B>", select <B>symbol</B></LI>

<P><LI>
make sure the <B>Dynamic map</B> option is checked.</LI>

<P><LI>
Leave other parameters unchanged and click <B>GO</B>.</LI>
</OL>

<P>
After a few seconds, the feature map should appear. A few comments:
<UL>
<P><LI>
Gata boxes appear in blue, Hap sites in red</LI>

<P><LI> Color boxes are either above or below the horizontal black
lines, accordingly to the strand (Watson or Crick respectively) of the
match.</LI>

<P><LI>
A specific symbol is associated to each pattern, allowing to distinguish
them when the feature map is printed in black and white</LI>

<P><LI> Coordinates are provided with reference to the ORF starting
position, negative values indicate an upstream, and positive values
for the coding sequences (0 corresponds to the first nucelotide ot the
start codon).

<P><LI>
Just for the fun, note the nice repetition of Hap-Gata site pairs in the
upstream sequence of GDH1.

<P><LI>
If your browser is recent, the map is dynamic. With your mouse, position
the cursor just above one of the sites in the sequences. Look now at the
bottom border of your Netscape window. The complete information about this
site is displayed. Move the cursor to another site and check that the information
is well updated. If you are using Internet Explorer, make sure to activate
the <B>status bar</B> (in the <B>View</B> menu).
