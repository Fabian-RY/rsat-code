<H3>Description</H3>

<UL>
Generate random DNA sequences according to various probabilistic
models (Markov chains or independently distributed nucleotides)
</UL>

<H3>Options</H3>

<UL>

<A NAME="length"></A>
<h4>Sequence length</h4>
<ul>
The length of each sequence.
</ul>

<A NAME="repet"></A>
<h4>Number of sequences</h4>
<ul>
Number of sequences. Most sequence format support multi-sequence files. 
</ul>

<A NAME="lw"></A>
<h4>Line width</h4>
<ul>
Line width. To obtain a single line per sequence, fill this option with 0. 
</ul>

<A NAME="lw"></A>
<h4>Sequence format</h4>
<ul>
Various sequence formats can be chosen through a pop-up menu. 
</ul>

<A NAME="proba"></A>
<h4>Nucleotide frequencies</h4>
<ul>

Random sequences can be generated according to different probabilistic models. 

<ul>

<li><b>Equiprobable nucleotides</B><br> This is the simplest model :
all nucleotides have the same prior probability.

<li><b>Independent nucleotides with distinct probabilities</b><br> A
specific prior probability can be attached to nucleotides (AT and CG
are grouped). This probability is constant over the sequence, i.e. each
nucleotide is generated independently of the preceding and succeeding
nucleotides.

<Li><b>Markov chains (calibrated on non-coding frequencies)</b><br>
The random sequence has the same oligonucleotide composition as
observed in the non-coding regions of the selected organism.  This is
obtained by a Markov chain process, where nucleotide probabilities
vary at each position, depending on the preceding nucleotides.

<ul>

<li><b>Organism</b> The reference organism (oligonucleotide
frequencies are pre-calculated for each supported organism, on the
basis of the complete set of non-coding sequences).

<li><b>Oligonucleotide length</b> The expected oligonucleotide
calibraiton table. The markov chain order is this value minus one (for
example, when hexnucleotides are selected, a Markov chain of order 5
is used.

</ul>


<br>The order of dependency is determined by the option
<b>oligonucleotide size</b>. 

</ul>

</ul>

<H3>Availability</H3>
<UL>

The program can be used through its web interface at:
<A HREF="http://ucmb.ulb.ac.be/bioinformatics/rsa-tools/" target=_blank>
http://ucmb.ulb.ac.be/bioinformatics/rsa-tools/</A> <BR>

random-seq is a perl script running on unix machines (SUN, SGI
have been tested). The web interface is a perl-cgi script.
