<H4>Description</H4>
<UL>
Calculates the positional distribution of oligonucleotides in a set of
sequences, and detects those which significantly discard from a
homogeneous distribution.


<P>
This program is useful for detecting patterns with a positional bias,
in large sets of sequences (e.g. a few hundreds or thousands of
sequences) aligned on some referencce (e.g. the start
codon). Significant patterns are not likely to be found in smaller
sequence sets. This tools is thus typically designed for pattern
discovery in full genomes rather than for small fmilies of
co-expressed genes.

<P>
<A NAME="class_grouping">
<B>Class grouping:</B></A><BR>

Positions are grouped by class interval. 
<ul>


<P>
<A NAME="class_interval">
<B>Class interval:</B></A> number of bases to group together. To avoid
class grouping, specify 1. The choice of the appropriate class
interval depends on several considerations.
<ul>

<li>Increasing the class interval reduces the resolution of the
analysis, but it smoothes the distributions.

<li>When class intervals are too short, the number of occurrences per
class may become too low, and the condition of applicability for the
chi2 will not be fulfilled for some oligonucleotides.

<li>For short oligonucleotides, smaller class intervals can be used,
since there are less idstinct possible words, and the number of
occurrences per word thus increases.

</ul>
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="origin">

<B>Origin:</B></A> reference position for class grouping. Positive
values specify a position relative to the sequence start, negative
values a position relative to sequence end. The default is to consider
sequence end, which is more relevant for upstream sequences. <b>Beware
! the default value -0 has a specific meaning</b>. For example :

<ul>
<li><b>0</b> : sequence start is used as reference, i.e. the first
letter of the sequence is the position 1.

<li><b>100</b> : the 100th letter of the sequence is the reference
(position 0) i.e. the 101th letter is the position 1, the 99th letter
position -1, ...

<li><b>-100</b> : the 100th letter of the sequence is the reference
(position 0) i.e. the 101th letter is the position 1, the 99th letter
position -1, ...


<li><b>-0 (default)</b> : sequence end is used as reference, i.e. the last
letter of the sequence is the position -1.

</ul>
<BR>


<P>
<A NAME="applicability">
<B>Condition of applicability for the chi2 test:</B></A><BR> A
condition of applicability for the chi2 test is that the expected
frequency shuld be >= 5 for each class. By default, this condition is
tested for each oligonucleotide, and, for those which do not fulfil
the test, the observed chi2 is displayed between curly brackets.

<ul>
<li>
<a name='Check'>The test for the condition of applicability can be
inactivated, in order to obtain real values in this column. It is not
recommended to inactivate it, since this may lead to false positives.

<li>
<a name=Filter'>This option filters out the oligonucleotides which do
not fulfil the condition of applicability for the chi2 test. The
output is lighter and easier to read.

</ul>

</ul>

<P>
<A NAME="oligo_length">
<B>Oligonucleotide size:</B></A><BR> The analysis can be performed
with oligonuleotides of any size between 1 and 8. Selecting size 1
amounts to counting the alphabet utilization within the input
sequeces. For the detection of regulatory sites, w recommend starting
with an analysis of hexanucleotides (size=6), and scanning sizes
between 4 and 8. When a pattern is significantly overrepresented, it
generaly appears from the analyses with various sizes.

<P>
<A NAME="count_strands">
<B>Count on:</B></A> (single or both strands)<BR> 

By selecting "both strands", the occurrences of each oligonucleotide
are summed on both strands. This allows to detect elements which act
in an orientation-insensitive way (as is generally the case for yeast
upstream elements). 

<P>
<A NAME="grouprc">
<B>Group reverse complement together in the output</B></A><BR> (only
valid for two strand analysis). This parameter does not affect the
counting itself, but only the format of output. If this option is NOT
checked, two separate lines are used to show a word and its reverse
complement. This is redundant but might be useful for compatibility
with other programs.

<P>
<A NAME="noov">
<B>Prevent overlapping matches</B></A><BR> Periodic pattern
(e.g. AAAAAA, ATATAT) have an aggregative tendency, i.e. each
occurrence of such a pattern strongly favours additional occurrences
in its immediate vicinity. This introduces a bias to most statistics
(binomial, log-likelihood). A simple way to correct for this bias is
to prevent counting twice mutually overlapping occurrences. <BR> For
example, <TT>TATATATATATA</TT> would represent
<UL>
<LI>2 occurrences of <TT>TATATA</TT> when self-overlap is prevented
<LI>5 occurrences of <TT>TATATA</TT> when self-overlap is allowed
</UL>
Note that Z-score introduce a correction for self-overlapping patterns
(see van Helden et al., 1999), but Z-scores are only valid for very
large sequences (for example a set of 6000 downstream sequences), and
are not appropriate for small gene clusters such as those extracted
from DNA chip experiment.
