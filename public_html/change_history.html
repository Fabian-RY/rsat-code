Change summary
</H2></CENTER>

<P>
The Regulatory Sequence Analysis tools are evolving regularly. We
summarize here the important steps in this evolution. In addition,
this summary only started in September 2002 (although the tools exist
since 1997).

<P>
A detailed list of program modifications (including those anterior to
September 2002) can be obtained on request to Jacques van Helden (<a
href=mailto:jvanheld@ucmb.ulb.ac.be>jvanheld@ucmb.ulb.ac.be</a>).

<td><a href=dyad-analysis_form.cgi>dyad-analysis</a></td>
<td>Support different bacground models : intergenic (as previously), upstream, upstream-noorf</td>

<td>2002/10/22</td>
<td><a href=pattern-assembly_form.cgi>pattern-assembly</a></td>
<td>Added a form for pattern-assembly (previously, it was only available through the result of dyad-assembly or oligo-assembly)</td>

program.</td>

<td>2002/09/16</td>
<td><a href=orf-info_form.cgi>orf-info</a></td>
<td>Added an option to match queries against gene description
(previously, queries were only matched against gene names and
identifiers).</td>

<td><a href=tutorials/tut_oligo-analysis.html>oligo-analysis tutorial</a></td>
<td>improved the tutorial in several ways
<ol>
<li>changed the example to the MET family
<li>added an explanation about result interpretation
<li>use the min feature thickness to highlight the Met3p binding site in the feature map. 
</ol>

<tr valign=top>
<td>2002/09/13</td>
<td><a href=retrieve-seq_form.cgi>retrieve-seq</a></td>
<td>The default is now to prevent overlap with upstream ORFs. This is
essential for bacteria, to avoid taking large fragments of coding
sequences, when the gene is in the middle of an operon. Actually, for
bacteria, the distance to the upstream ORF is < 50bp for more than
half of the genes.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td>2002/09/14</td>
<td><a href=oligo-analysis_form.cgi>oligo-analysis</a></td>
<td>different background models are supported: intergenic, all
upstream sequences (with or without overlap with upstream ORFs).
</td>
</tr>


<tr valign=top>
<td>2002/09/12</td>
<td><a href=random-genes_form.cgi>random-genes</a></td>
<td>A new program, allowing to select random genes in a given
genome. The selected genes can be piped to retrieve-seq. This program
is important for testing the rate of false positive returned by the
different pattern discovery programs.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign=top>
<td>2002/09/12</td>
<td><a href=oligo-analysis_form.cgi>oligo-analysis</a> and <a

sig index.</td>

<td>For double strand counts of occurrences, I changed the way to
calculate the binomial probability. See the <a

detail.</td>
