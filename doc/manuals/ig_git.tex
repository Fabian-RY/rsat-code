\section{Downloading \RSAT from the CVS server}

\textbf{Warning:} the \program{git} distribution is reserved to the
members of the \RSAT team. 

For external users, \RSAT is distributed as a tar archive (file
\file{rsat\_YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz}, where YYYY-MM-DD indicates the
release date). If you are not a member of the \RSAT team you can thus
skip this section.

\subsection{Obtaining a first version of \RSAT sowftare distribution}

The following command should be used the first time you retrieve the
tools from the server (you need to replace \texttt{[mylogin]} by the
login name you received when signing the \RSAT license).

\begin{lstlisting}
git clone git@depot.biologie.ens.fr:rsat
\end{lstlisting}


This will create a directory \file{rsat} on your computer, and
store the programs in it. Note that at this stage the programs are not
yet functional, because you still need to install genomes, which are
not included in the CVS distribution.

\subsection{Updating \RSAT programs}

Once the tools have been retrieved, you can obtain updates very
easily. For this, you need to change your directory to the rsat
directory, and use the \texttt{cvs} command in the following way.

\begin{lstlisting}
cd rsat
cvs -q update -d
\end{lstlisting}
