<H4>Description</H4>
<UL>
Calculates oligonucleotide occurrences in a set of sequences, and detects locally overrepresented oligonucleotides.
<P>
</UL>

<H4>Options</H4>
<UL>

<P>
<A NAME="sequence"></A>
<B>Input sequence:</B><BR>

The sequence that will be analyzed. Multiple sequences can be entered
at once with several <a href=help.formats.html>sequence formats</a>.

<P>
<A NAME="sequence_format"></A>
<B>Format:</B><BR>

Input sequence format. <a href=help.formats.html>Various standards</a>
are supported.


<P>
<A NAME="sequence_type"></A>
<B>Sequence type:</B><BR>

Input sequence type (DNA) <BR>


Only A, C, G, and T residues are accepted. oligomers that contain
undefined (N) or partly defined (IUPAC code) nucleotides are discarded
from the countings.

<P>
<A NAME="purge"></A>
<B>Purge sequences (highly recommended)</B><BR> When checked,
large duplicated regions (>= 40 bp alignment with less than 3
mismatches) are filtered out before analysis. Purging is essential
for any pattern discovery process, to avoid a bias due to
non-independence of sequences. Purging is performed with the programs
<TT>mkvtree</TT> and <TT>vmatch</TT> developed by <a
href=http://www.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/kurtz>Stefan Kurtz</a> (<a
href="mailto:kurtz@zbh.uni-hamburg.de">kurtz@zbh.uni-hamburg.de</a>).

<P>
<A NAME="oligo_length"></A>
<B>Oligonucleotide size:</B><BR>

The analysis can be performed with oligonuleotides of any size between
1 and 8. Selecting size 1 amounts to counting the alphabet utilization
within the input sequeces. For the detection of regulatory sites, w
recommend starting with an analysis of hexanucleotides (size=6), and
scanning sizes between 4 and 8. When a pattern is significantly
overrepresented, it generaly appears from the analyses with various
sizes.

<P>
<A NAME="count_strands"></A>
<B>Count on:</B> (single or both strands)<BR> 

By selecting "both strands", the occurrences of each oligonucleotide
are summed on both strands. This allows to detect elements which act
in an orientation-insensitive way (as is generally the case for yeast
upstream elements). 


<P>
<A NAME="align"></A>
<B>Align:</B> (Right or Left)<BR> 

By selecting "Right", the position in all input sequences are computed relatively 
to the right bound of each sequence. Align "Right" should be used when dealing with a set of
upstream sequences that have different lengths.

<P>
<A NAME="window_width"></A>
<B>Window Width:</B><BR> 

Different size of of window can be used to search for locally  over-represented motif.
This parameter can be fixed to an integer value or to set "auto" for a variable window width.


<P>
<A NAME="bgwindow_width"></A>
<B>Background Window Width:</B><BR> 

The background model can be fragmented in several segments of a fixed width.


<P>
<A NAME="noov"></A>
<B>Prevent overlapping matches</B><BR> 

Periodic patterns (e.g. AAAAAA, ATATAT) have an aggregative tendency,
i.e. each occurrence of such a pattern strongly favours additional
occurrences in its immediate vicinity. This introduces a bias to most
statistics (binomial, log-likelihood). A simple way to correct for
this bias is to prevent counting twice mutually overlapping
occurrences. <BR>

For example, <TT>TATATATATATA</TT> would represent
<UL>
<LI>2 occurrences of <TT>TATATA</TT> when self-overlap is prevented
<LI>5 occurrences of <TT>TATATA</TT> when self-overlap is allowed
</UL>

Note that Z-score introduces a correction for self-overlapping patterns
(see van Helden et al., 1999), but Z-scores are only valid for very
large sequences (for example a set of 6000 downstream sequences), and
are not appropriate for small gene clusters such as those extracted
from DNA chip experiment.

<P>
<A NAME="exp_freq"></A>
<B>Expected frequency:</B><BR>

Various probabilistic models can be used to estimate the expected
frequency of each oligonucleotide. <BR>

<UL>

<P>

<B>Warning !</B> 

The results will be dramatically affected by the choice of expected
frequency, which is the main specificity of this program. It has been
shown that for the detection of regulatory sites in yeast upstream
sequences, the best choice is to estimate the expected oligonucleotide
frequencies on basis of the frequencies observed in the set of all
intergenic sequences from the genome. For the same purpose, choosing
"equiprobable residues" would be totally inefficient, and "Residue
frequencies from input sequence" works poorly.


<P>
<A NAME="background"></A>
<!--
<p><li><B>Predefined background frequencies :</B>


Compare oligo frequencies observed in the query sequence to those of a
reference sequence (the background model).

<P>
Pre-calculted tables are used to estimate expected oligonucleotide
frequencies (background frequencies). These tables were obtained by
counting all oligonucleotide frequencies (from size 1 to 8) in
different sequence types, and this for each organism.

<ul>
<li><b>upstream</b>: all upstream regions, allowing overlap with
upstream ORFs.

<li><b>upstream-noorf</b>: all upstream regions, preventing overlap
with upstream ORFs (sequences are clipped to discard upstream ORF
sequences).

<li><b>intergenic</b>: all the intergenic regions, including upstream
and downstream sequences.
</ul>
-->
<p><li><B>Markov chain :</B> expected word (oligonucleotide) frequencies
are calculated on the basis of the subword frequencies observed in the
input sequence set. This calculation takes into account the higher
order dependencies between neighbouring residues. 

<P>
For example, with a markov chain of order 4 :
<UL><PRE>
P(GATAAC) = P(GATAA) * P(C|GATAA)
          = P(GATAA) * P(ATAAC) / P(ATAA)
</PRE></UL>
Thus

<UL><PRE>
Expected(GATAAC) = observed(GATAA) * observed(ATAAC) / observed(ATAA)
</PRE></UL>

For words of size k, the highest possible order is k-2. A Markov order
of 0 amounts to use observed residue frequencies for calculating
expected oligomer frequencies (no dependency between neighbour
residues).
<P>
The higher the Markov order, the most stringent is the analysis:
specificity is increased, but there si a loss of sensitivity,
i.e. some relevant patterns might be overlooked. The optimal markov
order depends on the size of the sequence set. For small gene families
(e.g. 10 sequences of 800bp), taking an order > 1 would result in a
loss of sensitivity. For sequence sets of 1Mb, a Markov chain of 3 is
optimal for hexanucleotides.

<p><li><B>Residue frequencies from input sequence :</B> (Note: this is
equivalent to a markov chain with order 0).

</ul>


<P>
<A NAME="thresholds"></A>
<B>Thresholds:</B><BR>
<ul>

Thresholds can be imposed to select the most significantly
overrepresented patterns. When acting on probabilities, upper
thresholds are used (i.e. values smaller than the threshold are
returned). For occurrence numbers, matching sequences and significance
indices, lower thresholds are used (i.e. all values higher than the
threshold are returned).  A threshold of 0 on occurrence significance
index is selected by default. This is the most efficient way we found
to automatically select the biologicaly significant regulatory sites,
irrespective of oligonucleotide size, number and size of the sequences
in the input set.

<!--
<A NAME="proba"></A>
<H4>Probabilities</H4>
<UL>

Various calibration models can be used to estimate the probability of
each oligonucleotide (see above). From there, and expected number of
occurrences is calculated and compared to the observed number of
occurrences. The significance of the observed number of occurrences is
calculated with the binomial formulae.  

<P>
<PRE>
    EXPECTED OCCURRENCES
	                          S
	   Exp_occ = p * T = p * SUM (Lj + 1 - k)
	                         j=1
	
	where	p  = probability of the pattern
		     Severay models are supported for estimating the
		     prior probability (see options -a, -expfreq and
		     -bg).
		S  = number of sequences in the sequence set. 
		Lj = length of the jth regulatory region
		k  = length of oligomer
                T = the number of possible matching positions.
		


    PROBABILITY OF SEQUENCE MATCHING
	The probability to find at least one occurrence of the pattern within
	a single sequence is :
	
	                 T
	    q = 1 - (1-p)
	    
	with the same abbreviations as above


    EXPECTED NUMBER OF MATCHING SEQUENCES

	In this counting mode, only the first occurrence of each
	sequence is taken into connsideration. We have thus to
	calculate a probability of first occurrence.

	   Exp_ms = n (1 - (1 - p)^T)
	
	with the same abbreviations as above
	
	Correction for autocorrelation (from Mireille Regnier)
		Exp_ms_corrected = n (1 - (1 - p/a)^T)
	   Where 
		 a is the coefficient of autocorrelation
		
    
    PROBABILITY OF THE OBSERVED NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES (BINOMIAL)
	
	The probability to observe exactly obs occurrences in the whole family
  	of sequences is calculated by the binomial
	
	                                              obs      T-obs
	    P(obs) = bin(p,T,obs) =       T!         p    (1-p)
                                     ---------------
                                     obs! * (T-obs)! 
	
	where   obs is the observed number of occurrences,
                p   is the expected frequency for the pattern,
                T   is the number of possible matching positions,
                    as defined above. 
	
	The probability to observe obs or more occurrences in the whole family
  	of sequences is calculated by the sum of binomials:
	
	                 T              obs-1
	    P(>=obs) =  SUM P(i) =  1 -  SUM  P(i)
	               i=obs             i=0

    OVER/UNDER-REPRESENTATION

		By default, the program calculates probability to have
		at least obs occurrences:

			                 T
			    P(>=occ) =  SUM P(i)
			               i=occ

		With the option -under, the program calculates the
		probability of having less than obs occurrences : 

			               occ-1
			    P(<=occ) =  SUM P(i)
			                i=0

		The option -under does not affect the other statistics
		(zscore, loglikelihood). For z-score, the negative
		values can be used to asses word under-representation.

	                        
    SPECIFIC TREATMENT FOR DOUBLE STRAND COUNTS

	When occurrences are counted on both strands, each pattern is
	grouped with its erverse complement. 

	For reverse-palindromic patterns, probabilities are calculated
	on the basis of the single strand count, since the occurrence
	on the reverse complement strand is completely dependent on
	that on the direct strand. 

        A more biological justification for this is that, although the
        word is foudn on both strands in a string representation of
        the sequences, at the structural level, there is a single
        binding site for the factor. 


	On the contrary, for non-palindrommic patterns, occurrences on
        the direct and reverse complement strand represent distinct
        binding sites. Thus, 

		 Obs_occ(W|Wr) = Obs_occ(W) + Obs_occ(Wr)
		 Exp_freq(W|Wr) = Exp_freq(W) + Exp_freq(Wr)

	   where
		 W     is a given word
		 Wr    is the reverse complement of W

	Probabilities are then calculated as above, on the basis of
	the event W|Wr instead of simply W.

    E-VALUE

	The probability of occurrence by itself is not fully
	informative, because the threshold must be adapted depending
	on the number of patterns considered. Indeed, a simple
	hexanucleotide analysis amounts to consider 4096
	hypotheses. 

	The E-value represented the expected number of patterns which
	would be returned at random for a given P-value (probability).

	      E-value = NPO * P(>=obs)

	where	NPO	 is the number of possible oligomers of the 
	                 chosen length (eg 4096 for hexanucleotides). 

        Note that when searches are performed on both strands, NPO is
        corrected for the fact that non-palindromic patterns are
        grouped by pairs (for example, there are 2080 patterns when
        hexanucleotides are counted on both strands).


    SIGNIFICANCE INDEXES

        The significance index is simply a negative logarithm
        conversion of the E-value (in base 10).


	The significance indexes are calculated as follows:
	
	      Sig_occ = -log10(E-value);

	This index is very convenient to interpret : highest values
	correspond to the most exceptional patterns.


    OVERLAP COEFFICIENT
        overlap coefficient is calculated as follows 
        (after Pevzner et al.(1989). J. Biomol. Struct & Dynamics 
        5:1013-1026):

	           l    
            Kov = SUM kj (1/4)^j
                  j=1

        where l  is the pattern length. 
              j  is the overlap position, comprised between 0 and l.
              kj takes the value 1 if there is an overlap at pos j,
                 0 otherwise.

        When counts are performed on both strands, overlaps between
        the pattern and its reverse complement are also taken into account
        into the same formula.			

    Z-SCORE
	The Z-score is calculated in the following way

		Zsc = (obs_occ - exp_occ)/var_occ
	where
		obs_occ	is the observed number of occurrences
		exp_occ	is the expected number of occurrences
		var_occ	is the estimate for the variance on occurrences

	The estimation of the variance is derived from Pevzner et al.(1989). 
	J Biomol Struct & Dynamics 5:1013-1026):
		var_occ = exp_occ(2*Kov - 1 - (2*w-1)*exp_occ)

	In random sequences, Z-scores are normally distributed. The probability 
	to observe a given number of occurrences can thus be read in the 
	normal table from any book of statistics.

	Advantages of the Z-score:
	- Z-score corrects the bias due to self-overlapping of a word, which 
	  often leads to overestimate the overrepresentation of such words
	  (eg AAAAAA, TATATA). 
	- its calculation is very fast. 
	  This is especially critical when analyzing 
	  very big sequences (whole genomes), where the expected oligont 
	  occurrences are very high (and binomial calculation very slow).
	- Z-score provides a way to detect both over- and under-represented 
	  patterns. 

	Disadvantages:	
	- the use of Z-score assumes that the sequences are infinite

	Recommended thresholds:
