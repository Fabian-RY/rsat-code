<h3>I cannot find my gene(s)</h3><ul>

<h4>Question</h4>
I am trying to retrieve sequences from the genome of <i>Myorg
sp.</i>, and for some genes (XXX, YYY and ZZZ), the progrm returns the
following message:

<ul><pre>
;WARNING	invalid query XXX
;WARNING	invalid query YYY
;WARNING	invalid query ZZZ
</pre></ul>

Am I using the wrong names for these genes?  Can you help?
</i>

<h4>Answer</h4>
Genomes are parsed from the NCBI distribution :

<ul><a target=_blank href=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/</a></ul>


<p>
Please check if your genes are correctly annotated at NCBI ? This is
generally the reason why genes are not identified on rsa-tools.

<p>
In case your gene names would be annotated in the NCBI files and not
in RSAT, please contact me and I will try to fix the problem. If the
info is missing from the NCBI files, you should contact them.

<p>
If the genes are not there, you could have a look at the EMBL genome
distribution.

<p>
EMBL an Genbank/NCBI are supposed to be synchronized, but for some
reason, their genome annotations (and in particular gene names) are
not. It is frequent that some genes are annotated at Genbank, whilst
some other at EMBL (fortunately, there is <i>some</i> overlap).
