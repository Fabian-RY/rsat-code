    RSAT::GraphNode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GraphNode class.

################################################################
=pod 

=item B<get_neighbours>

Return the direct neighbours of the node.

Usage: my @neighbours = $node->get_neighbours();

The output object is a list containing objects of the class
RSAT::GraphNeighbour.

################################################################
=pod

=item B<get_neighbours_step>


Return the direct and indirect neighbours of the node up to a certain
number of steps.

Usage: my @neighbours = $node->get_neighbours_step($steps, $self_included);

Parameters: 

$steps: maximal number of steps from the seed node

$self_included: if this attribute is set, the seed node is included in
the neighbourhood (with a distance 0), even if there is no self-loop.

The output object is a list containing objects of the class
RSAT::GraphNeighbour.
