\chapter{Web server configuration for \RSAT}

\section{Description}

This documents describes the installation procedure for the web server
of the \textbf{Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools} (\RSAT).

It assumes that you already installed the perl scripts and the
genomes, as described in the \RSAT installation guide.

% Web server installation

\section{Installing a local web server}

The Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools include a web server, which
offers a user-friendly interface for biologists. The main server is
available for academic users at \\
\url{http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/}

A few additional mirrors have been installed in different countries.

\subsection{Web server pages}

The web pages are located in the directory
\file{rsat/public\_html}. This directory contains both the HTML
pages, and the CGI scripts.

\subsection{Apache modules}

The RSAT interface relies on CGI (for the earlier tools) and PHP (for
the most recent tools). These modules should be installed on the web
server, and activated in the Apache configuration files. 

\subsubsection{PHP module for Mac OSX}

If your server is running under Mac OSX, you need to install a recent
version (at least v5) of the php module, which can be found at the following site. 

\url{http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/}

\subsection{Configuration of the Apache server}

In order to provide web access to the Regulatory Sequence Analysis
Tools (\RSAT), you need to adapt the configuration of your web
server. This requires root privileges (can be done only by the system
administrator of the computer).


\begin{enumerate}
\item A default configuration file is provided with the \RSAT
  distribution (\file{rsat\_apache\_default.conf}). Edit this file to
  replace the string \textt{[RSAT\_PARENT\_PATH]} by the actual
  location of your rsat folder.
  
\item The file should then be copied to some appropriate place in the
  Apache configuration folder of your computer. This place depends on
  the operating system (Mac OSX or Linux) and on the distribution
  (Linux Ubuntu, Centos, ...).
  
  Some Usual places:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item On Centos: \file{/etc/httpd/conf.d/rsat.conf}
  \item On Ubuntu: \file{/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/rsat.conf}
  \end{itemize}
  
\item You need to restart the Web server (the command depends on your
  OS. Can be \program{apachectl}, \program{httpd} or
  \program{apache2ctl}.

  \begin{lstlisting}
    sudo apache2ctl restart
  \end{lstlisting}

\item Checking the configuration file for the \RSAT server. Check that
  the properties are properly defined in the \RSAT property file
  \file{$RSAT/RSAT\_config.props}. In principle you already configured
  in the beginning of the installation, with the command
  \begin{lstlisting}
    perl perl-scripts/configure_rsta.pl
  \end{lstlisting}

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Configuring the RSAT options for the web server}

You need to adapt the RSAT configuration file to indicate the
configuration of your server. For this, edit the \RSAT property file
\texttt{\$RSAT/RSAT\_config.props}.

The simplest way to update the config file is to run the interactive
configuration script.
Alternatively, you can edit this file with a text edito of your
choice.

You also need to edit \texttt{\$RSAT/RSAT\_config.mk}. 

\subsubsection{IP address of your machine}

By default, the RSAT web server is configured to be used from the
machine on which it is installed. 

\begin{lstlisting}
$WWW_RSA = 	"http://localhost/rsat/";
\end{lstlisting}

If you want to give access from browsers located on other computers
than your server, you need to adapt the following line and replace
``localhost'' by the IP address of your machine. Let us assume that
your mahine has the address www.myserver. You should then edit the row
as follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
$WWW_RSA = 	"http://www.myserver/rsat/";
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Setting the environment variable RSAT}

%% For the basic RSAT configuration, you had to define an environment
%% variable RSAT. This is necessary for the perl program to know the
%% location of your programs. If this variable is not specified, the
%% scripts are stopped with an error message.

%% \begin{lstlisting}
%% unless ($ENV{RSAT}) {
%%     die "Error: the environment variable RSAT needs to be defined\n";
%% }
%% \end{lstlisting}

%% Since the web server is ran by another user, you need to define this
%% environment variable for this user as well. For this, edit the
%% above line in the following way.

%% \begin{lstlisting}
%% unless ($ENV{RSAT}) {
%%     $ENV{RSAT} = "[RSAT_PARENT_PATH]/rsat";
%% }
%% \end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Testing the web server}

To test the werb server, open a web browser and connect your \RSAT
server (of course you need to adapt the following URL according to
your IP address).

\url{http://www.myserver/rsat/} 

If the connection works, try to execute the demonstration of the
following pages.

\begin{description}
\item[\program{supported organisms}] to check that genomes have
  been insalled.
  
\item[\program{retrieve-seq}] to test the correct installation of
  genomes.

\item[\program{oligo-analysis}] to test the correct installation of
  background oligonucleotide frequencies.

\item[\program{feature-map}] to test the correct installation of the
  graphical librairies.
\end{description}

\section{Managing a local web server}

\subsection{Access logs}

Each time a script is executed via the \RSAT server, some basic
information is stored in a log file. This information is minimal: it
is restricted to the time, name of the script executed, and the IP
address of the client machine. We do not want to store any additional
information (e.g. selected organism, lists of genes), for obvious
confidentiality reasons.

The log files are saved in the directory \file{\$RSAT/logs}. There
is one file per month.


\subsection{Cleaning the temporary directory}

The web server stores result files in a temporary directory
\file{\$RSAT/public\_html/tmp/}. These files should remain 3 days on
the server, in order to allow users to consult their results.

\subsubsection{Manual cleaning}

The \RSAT package includes a make script to clean old files in the
temporary directory.

\begin{lstlisting}
cd $RSAT
make -f makefiles/server.mk clean_tmp
\end{lstlisting}

This command cleans all the files older than 3 days. You can clean
more recent files by modifying the variable CLEAN\_DATE.

\begin{lstlisting}
make -f makefiles/server.mk clean_tmp  CLEAN_DATE=1
\end{lstlisting}

This will clean all files older than 1 day.

\subsubsection{Automatic cleaning}

The automatic management of the temporary directory can be greatly
facilitated the \program{crontab} command. For this, you need to add a
command to your personal \texttt{crontab} configuration file.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start to edit the crontab command file

\begin{lstlisting}
crontab -e
\end{lstlisting}

This will open your \file{crontab} file with your default text editor
(this default editor can be specified with the environment variable
EDITOR or VISUAL).

\item Add the following line to the \file{crontab} file. 

\begin{lstlisting}
02 04 * * * make -f [RSAT_PARENT_PATH]/rsat/makefiles/server.mk clean_tmp
\end{lstlisting}

This will execute the make script \file{server.mk}, with the target
\texttt{clean\_tmp}, every day, at 04:02 AM. 

\item Save the modified crontab file and close your text editor.

\end{enumerate}

In principle, you will receive an email from \program{crontab} each
time the command is executed.

Note that the command \program{crontab} takes effect only if the
system administrator has activated the command \command{cron}. If you
notice that the temporary files are not properly cleaned, please
contact your system administrator to check the cron command.

\section{Compiling the Perl Stubb for Web services}

Web services \footnote{beware, this is not the same as Web server}
enable external programs to remotely address queries to your Web
server. The \RSAT Web server relies on Web services for various
purposes (e.g. synchronizing genomes between servers). Besides the
Network Analysis Tools are based on a multi-tier architecture relying
on Web services.

To use the \RSAT and NeAT Web services, you need to compile the Stubb
in order to synchronize the Perl modules of your client with the
service specification of the server.

\begin{lstlisting}
## Compile the stubb.
## Your computer will open a connection to the Web services server 
## and collect the WSDL specifications of the supported services.
cd $RSAT
make -f makefiles/init_RSAT.mk ws_stubb

## Test the connection to the Web services
cd $RSAT/ws_clients/perl_clients
make test
\end{lstlisting}
