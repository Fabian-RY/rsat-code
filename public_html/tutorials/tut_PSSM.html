<a name=prerequisite></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>

Position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) offer a sensitive way to
represent the specificity of transcription factor/DNA interfaces. PSSM
are built on the basis of a set of known binding sites for the factor
of interest.  

<P>
Knowledge-based PSSM can be obtained from various transcription factor
databases (e.g. <a target=_blank
href=http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/databases.html#transfac>TRANSFAC</a>).

<a name=example></a><h3>Example</h3>

The matrix below was obtained from <a
href="http://rulai.cshl.edu/SCPD/" TARGET=_blank> SCPD</a>, the
<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> promoter database.  


<p>This matrix has been built from an alignment of 12 binding sites
for the yeast transcription factor Pho4p. 


<h4><i>PHO4 matrix (source: SCPD)</i></h4> 
<PRE>
A |  3   2   0  12   0   0   0   0   1   3
C |  5   2  12   0  12   0   1   0   2   1
G |  3   7   0   0   0  12   0   7   5   4
T |  1   1   0   0   0   0  11   5   4   4
</PRE>


<P>Each row represents one residue (A, C, G or T), and each column a
position in a set of aligned binding sites. Some positions are
perfectly conserved across all known binding sites (the motif CACGT
starting at the 3rd position), whereas some other positions present
two choices (e.g. G or T at position 8), and other position can
contain any letter, but with different frequencies (e..g first and
last position).


<h3>Matrix scores</h3>

<P>When the matrix is used to scan sequences for putative Pho4p binding
sites, the more conserved positions impose stronger constraints than
those where any nucleotide can be found. This allows thus a more
quantitative evaluation of the binding affinity than <a
href=tut_strings.html>string-based representations</a>.

<p>Actually, the frequencies are not used as such to score putative
sites. The score assigned assigned to a piece of sequence <i>S</i> is
calculated as the log-ratio of two probabilities:
<ul>

<p><li><i>P(S|M)</i>, the probability to observe sequence <i>S</i> given
the motif model <i>M</i> (the matrix).

<p><li><i>P(S|B)</i>, the probability to observe sequence <i>S</i> given
the background model <i>B</i> (the genomic context).

<p><li>The score of a sequence segment is <i>W<sub>S</sub>=log[P(S|M)/P(S|B)]</i>
</ul>


<p>With the matrix above, we could calculate the probability of a
sequence <i>S</i> of 10 nucleotides, as the product of the relative
frequencies of these nucleotides in the PSSM. 

<p>A critical issue is to chose an appropriate background model. The
simplest background models are based on a Bernoulli schema, which
means that they rely on an assumption that the nucleotides succeed to
each other independently. More elaborate models have been proposed,
based on Markov chains (the description of these models can be found
in my course material).

<h3>Higher order dependencies</h3>

<p>One weakness of PSSM is that they do not take into account higher
order dependencies between residues, i.e. correlations between the
residue found at a given position and those found at other
positions. Even if, with Markov-chain based background models, such
dependencies are taken into account for the background model,
correlations between different positions of the binding sites are
still not taken into account.

<p>For example, a PSSM does not allow to specify a pattern
like <i>"either <tt>CACGTGGG</tt> or
<tt>CACGTTTT</tt>"</i> : if one builds a matrix where <tt>G</tt>
and <tt>T</tt> are allowed at the 3 last positions, any combination of
them will be allowed (e.g.  CACGTGTG, CACGTTGT). Higher order
dependencies can be represented with more elaborated methods, such as
Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which are ou of scope for this tutorial.


</ul><h2><a name=convert_matrix></a>Converting and analyzing PSSM</h2><ul>

The RSAT include a program called <a target=tools
href=../convert-matrix_form.cgi>convert-matrix</a>, which allows to
extract a PSSM from the output files of different programs (<a
target=tools href=../consensus_form.cgi>consensus</a>, <a
target=tools href=../gibbs_form.cgi>gibbs</a>, <a target=_blank
href=http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/>MEME</a>, clustal).


<p>I still did not find the time to write a tutorial for this program,
but you can already read the <a target=tools
href=../help.convert-matrix.html>manual</a>, and do your own test with
the demo data set (click DEMO at the bottom of the form).

<h3>Converting the counts into frequencies, weights and information</h3>

We will import a matrix representing the binding specificity of the
yeast transcription factor Abf1p, and analyze the different parameters
which characterize this PSSM.

<ol>

<p><li>Connect <a href="http://rulai.cshl.edu/SCPD/" target=_blank>
SCPD</a>, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae promoter database. To access
the list of sites by factor from the SCPD home page, click on the
Section "<a target=_blank
href=http://rulai.cshl.edu/cgi-bin/SCPD/getfactorlist>Regulatory
elements and transcriptional factors</a>".

<p><li>Click on the link to <a target=_blank
href=http://rulai.cshl.edu/cgi-bin/SCPD/getfactor?ABF1,BAF1>ABF1</a>,
and then on the button <b>Get matrix</b>. The following PSSM is
displayed.

<pre>
>ABF17121SCPD

A   0   0  11   2   3   7   3   5   5  14   0   1
T  14   0   2   1   6   2   7   3   0   0   0   0
G   0   0   0   0   2   3   1   2   3   0   1  13
C   0  14   1  11   3   2   3   4   6   0  13   0. 
</pre>

<p>Some basic questions

<ul>
<li>What is the alphabet size ?

<li>What is the matrix width ?

<li>How many inding sites were used to build this matrix ? 

<li>How many Abf1p binding sites are currently stored in SCPD (click on the button <b>Get sites</b>)?
</ul>

<p><li>We will now analyze the content of this matrix with the
program <i>convert-matrix</i>. In the left menu of the RSAT page,
select the form <a target=tools
href=../convert-matrix_form.cgi><b>convert matrix</b></a>.

<p><li>Copy the ABF1 matrix from SCPD to the text area in the
form. 

<ul><b>Beware</b>, you should only copy the 4 rows containing the
nucleotide information, and not the matrix header.</uL>

<p><li>Make sure that the selected matrix format is <b><i>tab</i></b>.


<p><li>For the <b><i>Return fields</i></b>, select the following options:
<ul>
<li>counts
<li>frequencies
<li>weights
<li>info
<li>margins
<li>parameters
</ul>
<p><li>click <b>GO</b>.
</ol>

<h3>Matrix conversions</h3><ul>

The original matrix was converted into different formats. We will briefly
comment these formats. 

<h4><i>Counts</i></h4><ul>

This is the promary information obtained from SCPD. Counts represent
the absolute frequencies of each residue at each position of the
alignment of the annotated binding sites for the transcription factor
Abf1p.

</ul><h4><i>Frequencies</i></h4><ul> 

You will notice that the frequency matrix does not faithfully reflect
the relative frequencies calculated from the counts. In particular,
the cells of the original matrix with count values of 0 have values
larger than 0 in the frequency matrix.

<p>You can check this by coming back to the convert-matrix form (click
the <i>Back</i> button of your brower), and redoing the conversion
with a value of 0 for the option <i><b>pseudo-weight</b></i>.

</ul><h4><i>Weights</i></h4><ul> 

The weight is the score described above, i.e. the log-likelihood between 
<ul>
<li><i>P(S|M)</i>, the probability to observe the sequence <i>S</i>
given the motif model (matrix) <i>M</i>, and

<li><i>P(S|B)</i>, the probability to observe the sequence <i>S</i>
given the background model <i>B</i>.
</ul>

<p>Positive weights indicate that the residue is considered to favour
the binding of the transcription factor, negative weights that it is
unfavorable.

</ul><h4><i>Info</i></h4><ul> 

The information content of each cell of the matrix is calculated by
multiplying the weight by the frequency. The information content of a
row (column) is the sum of information contents of its cells.

</ul>

</ul><h2>Next steps</h2><ul>


<ol>

<p><li>PSSM can be used to detect occurrences of a motif in
sequences. Matrix-based pattern matching will be introduced in the
tutorial on <a href=tut_patser.html>patser</a>.</li></p>

<p><li>Since 2008, RSAT includes its own pattern matching
tool, <a href=matrix-scan.cgi>matrix-scan</a>, for which we will write
a tutorial as soon as possible. This tool includes all the
functionalities of patser plus a few more (Markov-chain background
models, CRM prediction, ...).</li></p>

<p><li>Several pattern-discovery programs allow to detect significant
motifs represented as PSSM from a set of unaligned sequences. These
programs have been used to predict regulatory elements in the
regulatory regions of sets of co-regulated genes. Matrix-based pattern
discovery will be discussed in the tutorials on the <a
href=tut_gibbs.html>gibbs sampler</a> and <a
href=tut_consensus.html>consensus</a>.</li></p>
