\chapter{Pathway extraction tools}

\section{Using pathway extraction tools}

\subsection{Listing tools and getting help}
You can list available tools by typing:

\begin{verbatim}
java graphtools.util.ListTools
\end{verbatim}

All tools provide a \option{-h} option to display help.

\subsection{Abbreviating tool names}
The command line tool names may be simplified by setting aliases.
For example, in the bash shell:
\begin{verbatim}
alias Pathfinder="java graphtools.algorithms.Pathfinder"
\end{verbatim}
allows to type:
\begin{verbatim}
Pathfinder -h
\end{verbatim}
instead of:
\begin{verbatim}
java graphtools.algorithms.Pathfinder -h
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Increasing JVM memory}
For large graphs, you may need to increase the memory allocated to the java virtual machine.
You can do so by specifying the \option{-Xmx} option.
Example:
\begin{verbatim}
java -Xmx800m graphtools.algorithms.Pathfinder -h
\end{verbatim}

\section{Build metabolic networks}

\subsection{Build KEGG generic metabolic networks} 

To build the directed reaction network, type:

\begin{verbatim}
java -Xmx800m graphtools.parser.KeggLigandDataManager -m
\end{verbatim}

The execution of this command takes quite long, because it fetches the reaction
and compound files from KEGG's FTP repository at \ftp{ftp.genome.jp}. 
To get these files, the \program{KeggLigandDataManager} requires
\program{wget} to be installed and in your path. \program{wget} is 
freely available from \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/}.

Alternatively, you may first download the reaction and compound files yourself
from the KEGG ftp server. Type in your browser (or in your favourite ftp
client): \url{ftp://anonymous@ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/ligand/compound/compound}
and save the compound file into \RSAT\file{/data/KEGG/KEGG_LIGAND}. Do the same
for the reaction file at
\url{ftp://anonymous@ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/ligand/reaction/reaction}. 
Then you can run the command above to generate the reaction network.

To construct the undirected RPAIR network, type:

\begin{verbatim}
java -Xmx800m graphtools.parser.KeggLigandDataManager -s -u
\end{verbatim}

For the reaction-specific undirected RPAIR network, type:

\begin{verbatim}
java graphtools.parser.KeggLigandDataManager -t -u
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Build KEGG organism-specific metabolic networks}

The MetabolicGraphProvider tool allows you to merge KEGG KGML files into
a metabolic network specific to a set of organisms.
