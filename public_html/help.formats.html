<center><h2><a href="RSAT_home.cgi">RSA-tools</A> - supported sequence formats</h2></center>
<br/>
RSA-tools are dedicted to the analysis of regulatory sequences and thus only deals with DNA sequences. The following formats are supported. <P>

<ul>
<a name="raw"></a><LI><B>raw</b><br>

The text contains a single DNA sequence without any comment or other
text. The sequence should only contain the letters corresponding to
nucleotides (A, C, G, T). Uppercases and lowercases are onsidered
equivalent. Tabs (\t), blank spaces and newline characters (\n) are
accepted (they will be automatically removed before analysis). <P>

<UL>
<B>Example of raw format (a single 60 bp sequences)</B>
<PRE>GCGGTGCCCGGCCCAGCCACATATATATAGGTGTGTGCCA
CTCCCGGCCCCGGTATTAGC</PRE>
</UL>

<a name="multi"></a><LI><B>multi</b><br>

This is a variant of the raw format, allowing to include several
sequences within the same text. As in the raw format, there are
neither comments nor sequence identifiers. Tabs and white spaces are
ignored. The difference is that each new line is considered to contain
a distinct sequence.<P>

<B>Example of multi format (two distinct sequences, 60 bp each)</B>

</UL>

<a name="tab"></A><LI><B>tab</B><BR>

Tab-delimited text file with at least two columns. 
<br>Each row contains information about one sequence. 

<ol>
<li>The first column contains the sequence ID.</li>
<li>The second column contains the sequence, without any space. </li>
<li>Additional columns are ignored.
</ol>


<p><a name="fasta"></A><LI><B>fasta</B><BR>

This format was originally defined for the program FastA, and has been
used by a wide variety of other programs (FastA, BLAST, gibbs sampler,
...). 

<ul>
<li>A raw starting with a ">" indicates that a new sequence will begin
on the next row. The symbol ">" is immediately followed by the
sequence identifier, a single word.

<li>After the ID, additional text on the same line is considered as
comment (it is ignored in the sequence analysis).

<li>The sequence starts on the next line.

<li>White spaces, tabulations and newline characters can be inserted
within the sequence, and will be ignored for analysis.

<li>The sequence is read until the end of file is reached or another
line is found which begins with a ">".

<li>Several sequence can be concatenated within the same text.
</ul>

<A NAME="wconsensus"></A><LI><B>wconsensus</B><BR>
This is the format defined by Jerry Hertz for his programs patser, consensus and wconsensus. Lines beginning with a semiolon ";" or a "#" are considered as comments. The first word of the first non-comment sequence is the sequence identifier. The sequence follows, embraced in backslashes (\). <P>

<p>
<a name="ig"></a><LI><B>IG</b><br>

IntelliGenetics format. All lines beginning with a semicolon ";" are
considered as comments. The first non-comment line contains the
sequence identifier (a single word without spaces). The sequence
follows on the next lines. It can include spaces, tabs or newlines,
that will be ignored for sequence analysis. The end of one sequence is
indicated by termination character: 1 for linear, 2 for circular
sequences. Several sequences can be concatenated within the same
text. <P>

</ul><h4>Mask option</h4><ul>

<p>Mask lower- or uppercases, respecively, i.e. replace
selected cases by N characters. 

<p>This option is useful with some sequence formats where lowercases
indicated "soft masked" fragments. Soft masking is used by some genome
centers to indicate exonic sequences.

</ul><h4>Remarks</h4>

<ul>
<p><li>Most formats (except raw) support multiple sequences within the same
text. This is convenient for analyzing a family of sequences (oligo
analysis, pattern search).</li>

<p><li>The program <A HREF="convert-seq.html"><B>convert sequence</B></A>
performs interconversions between these sequence formats.</li>

</ul>
