  abstract = {The Gene Ontology (GO) project (http://www.geneontology.org/) provides
	a set of structured, controlled vocabularies for community use in
	annotating genes, gene products and sequences (also see http://www.sequenceontology.org/).
	The ontologies have been extended and refined for several biological
	areas, and improvements to the structure of the ontologies have been
	implemented. To improve the quantity and quality of gene product
	annotations available from its public repository, the GO Consortium
	has launched a focused effort to provide comprehensive and detailed
	annotation of orthologous genes across a number of 'reference' genomes,
	including human and several key model organisms. Software developments
	include two releases of the ontology-editing tool OBO-Edit, and improvements
	to the AmiGO browser interface.},

  abstract = {Protein complexes are key molecular entities that integrate multiple
	gene products to perform cellular functions. Here we report the first
	genome-wide screen for complexes in an organism, budding yeast, using
	affinity purification and mass spectrometry. Through systematic tagging
	of open reading frames (ORFs), the majority of complexes were purified
	several times, suggesting screen saturation. The richness of the
	data set enabled a de novo characterization of the composition and
	organization of the cellular machinery. The ensemble of cellular
	proteins partitions into 491 complexes, of which 257 are novel, that
	differentially combine with additional attachment proteins or protein
	modules to enable a diversification of potential functions. Support
	for this modular organization of the proteome comes from integration
	with available data on expression, localization, function, evolutionary
	conservation, protein structure and binary interactions. This study
	provides the largest collection of physically determined eukaryotic
	cellular machines so far and a platform for biological data integration
	and modelling.},

  abstract = {In a cell or microorganism, the processes that generate mass, energy,
	information transfer and cell-fate specification are seamlessly integrated
	through a complex network of cellular constituents and reactions.
	However, despite the key role of these networks in sustaining cellular
	functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Here
	we present a systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the
	metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains
	of life. We show that, despite significant variation in their individual
	constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same
	topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to
	the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This
	may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for
	all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles
	of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent
	a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions
	among all cellular constituents.},

  journal = {Nucleic Acids Res},
  year = {2007},
  month = {Dec},
  abstract = {The Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS-GSF, Neuherberg,
	Germany) combines automatic processing of large amounts of sequences
	with manual annotation of selected model genomes. Due to the massive
	growth of the available data, the depth of annotation varies widely
	between independent databases. Also, the criteria for the transfer
	of information from known to orthologous sequences are diverse. To
	cope with the task of global in-depth genome annotation has become
	unfeasible. Therefore, our efforts are dedicated to three levels
	of annotation: (i) the curation of selected genomes, in particular
	from fungal and plant taxa (e.g. CYGD, MNCDB, MatDB), (ii) the comprehensive,
	consistent, automatic annotation employing exhaustive methods for
	the computation of sequence similarities and sequence-related attributes
	as well as the classification of individual sequences (SIMAP, PEDANT
	and FunCat) and (iii) the compilation of manually curated databases
	for protein interactions based on scrutinized information from the
	literature to serve as an accepted set of reliable annotated interaction
	data (MPACT, MPPI, CORUM). All databases and tools described as well
	as the detailed descriptions of our projects can be accessed through
	the MIPS web server (http://mips.gsf.de).},
