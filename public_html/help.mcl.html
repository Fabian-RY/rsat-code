<h4>Description</h4>
<ul>

 The MCL algorithm is short for the Markov Cluster Algorithm, a fast and scalable unsupervised cluster algorithm for graphs based on simulation of (stochastic) flow in graphs. The algorithm was invented/discovered by Stijn van Dongen at the Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science (also known as CWI) in the Netherlands. The input / output parsers, the webservices and the web interfaces were developped by Sylvain Broh&eacute;e.

</ul>

<h4>Options</h4><ul>
<A NAME="formats"></A>
<h4>Input and output formats</h4>
<ul>
<h4>Input formats</h4>
The accepted input formats are GML, tab-delimited and adjacency matrix. 
For more explanations about these, refer to the <a href = 'help.convert_graph.html'>manual of convert-graph</a>.


<h4>Output format</h4>
A tab-delimited text file with 2 columns. The first column
indicates the element, the second column the class (cluster). 

</ul>
<h4><A NAME="columns"></A>Column specifications (only for tab-delimited format)</h4>
<ul><A NAME="scol"></A><b>Source and target column</b>. Columns containing the source and target nodes. </ul>
<ul><A NAME="wcol"></A><b>Weight or label column</b> Column containing the weight or the label on the edge. </ul>

<h4><A NAME="inflation"></A>Inflation value</h4>
<ul> 	
This value is the main handle for affecting cluster granularity. It is usually chosen somewhere in the range [1.2-5.0]. Inflation of  5.0 will tend to result in fine-grained clusterings, and inflation of  1.2 will tend to result in very coarse grained clusterings. Your mileage will vary depending on the characteristics of your data. 
</ul>
