  title = {Evaluation of clustering algorithms for protein-protein interaction
	networks.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {488},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein interactions are crucial components of all cellular
	processes. Recently, high-throughput methods have been developed
	to obtain a global description of the interactome (the whole network
	of protein interactions for a given organism). In 2002, the yeast
	interactome was estimated to contain up to 80,000 potential interactions.
	This estimate is based on the integration of data sets obtained by
	various methods (mass spectrometry, two-hybrid methods, genetic studies).
	High-throughput methods are known, however, to yield a non-negligible
	rate of false positives, and to miss a fraction of existing interactions.
	The interactome can be represented as a graph where nodes correspond
	with proteins and edges with pairwise interactions. In recent years
	clustering methods have been developed and applied in order to extract
	relevant modules from such graphs. These algorithms require the specification
	of parameters that may drastically affect the results. In this paper
	we present a comparative assessment of four algorithms: Markov Clustering
	(MCL), Restricted Neighborhood Search Clustering (RNSC), Super Paramagnetic
	Clustering (SPC), and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE). RESULTS:
	A test graph was built on the basis of 220 complexes annotated in
	the MIPS database. To evaluate the robustness to false positives
	and false negatives, we derived 41 altered graphs by randomly removing
	edges from or adding edges to the test graph in various proportions.
	Each clustering algorithm was applied to these graphs with various
	parameter settings, and the clusters were compared with the annotated
	complexes. We analyzed the sensitivity of the algorithms to the parameters
	and determined their optimal parameter values. We also evaluated
	their robustness to alterations of the test graph. We then applied
	the four algorithms to six graphs obtained from high-throughput experiments
	and compared the resulting clusters with the annotated complexes.
	CONCLUSION: This analysis shows that MCL is remarkably robust to
	graph alterations. In the tests of robustness, RNSC is more sensitive
	to edge deletion but less sensitive to the use of suboptimal parameter
	values. The other two algorithms are clearly weaker under most conditions.
	The analysis of high-throughput data supports the superiority of
	MCL for the extraction of complexes from interaction networks.},

	the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This
	may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for

	of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent
	a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions

	Comparison with experimental data and functional annotation of genes
	showed two types of modules: (i) protein complexes (splicing machinery,
