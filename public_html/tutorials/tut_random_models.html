<p>The Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools include two tools that probably
fit your needs :


<ol>

<li><a href=../random-seq_form.cgi><b>random sequence</b></a>.  This
program generates random sequences on the basis of various
probabilistic background. One interesting model is to use Markov chain
models, calibrated on the complete set off upstream sequences of an
organism. This means that the generated sequences does not exist as a
biological sequences, but it has the same oligonucleotide composition
as the chosen background. 

<li><a href=../random-genes_form.cgi><b>random genes</b></a>. This
program selects a random set of gene identifiers in the selected
genome. The selected genes can then be piped to the program
retrieve-seq, which will retrieve the upstream sequences of the
randomly selected genes. In this case, you will analyze real
biological sequences, contrarily to the program random-sequences. The
analysis of random gene sets is very useful to evaluate the rate of
false positives of pattern discovery programs.

</ol>

<p>The analysis of random gene selections gives more realistic (and
more severe) conditions than the randomly generated sequences, which
rely on a quite strong assumption about the model underlying sequence
composition (e.g. Markov chain: which order is the most appropriate ?
Do biological sequences really resemble to the result of a Markov
process ? ...).
