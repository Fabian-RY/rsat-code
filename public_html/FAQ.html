<h3>P-value and E-value</h3>

<b>Remark: </b> the discussion below was about <i>compare-classes</i>,
but it applies to all the RSAT programs involving multiple tests, for
example <i>oligo-analysis</i>, <i>dyad-analysis</i>, <i>position-analysis</i>, <i>compare-progiles</i>,
...

<h4>Question</h4>

I am using your program at
http://rsat.ccb.sickkids.ca/compare-classes_form.cgi.  Could you
please comment on the significant number of P and E cut off?  I guess
if a number is less than 0.05 for p values, then we have a significant
overlap.  Just like in any other statistical techniques.  How about
E-value?  What is the significant threshold?

<h4>Answer</h4>

<p>
There is an essential difference between P-value and E-value.

<p>
The P-value represents the risk to consider as significant one
intersection, whereas it is not.  It is somehow the probability for
one intersection to be selected as false positive.

<p>Thus, if you have a query group with Q elements, and a reference group
with R elements, and the intersection is X, a P-value of 0.05 means
that there is 5% chances that two random groups of the same sizes
would have at least X elements at their intersection.

<p>
This P-value should be interpreted with an extreme caution, because
you generally compare several query classes with several reference
classes, you take the same risk (e.g.5%) for each comparison. For
example, if you are comparing a set 50 clusters of co-expression with
a database containing 150 regulons, you will perform 50*150=7500
comparisons. And for each of these comparisons, you take a risk of 5%
to select a false positive. Thus, for the whole battery of tests, you
would expect to select 7500*5%=375 false positives !

<p>
The E-value is precisely an estimation of the expected number of false
positives. For a battery of T tests.

<pre>
E-value = Pvalue * T
	= 7500*5% = 375
</pre>

<p>
Some authors call the E-value "Bonferoni-corrected P-value", but I
dont' like this expression, because the E-value is not a
probability. Indeed, P-values must by definition be comprized between
0 and 1, whereas the E-value can take any value between 0 and T (the
number of tests).

<p>
Actually, Bonferoni's rule consists in selecting a threshold on
P-value < 1/T. In practice, this is equivalent to select a threshold
on E-value < 1, which means that you expect less than 1 false positive
for the whole battery of tests.

<p>
In short, I recommend to interpret the results on the basis of the
E-value, NOT the P-value.

<h3>Supported genomes</h3><ul>

<h4>Would it be possible to install the genome of XXX on the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools ? </h4>

Genomes are parsed from the NCBI genome repository.

<p><ul><a target=_blank href=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/</a></ul>
   
<p>
Some additional genomes are imported from the ENSEMBL database. 
<p><ul><a target=_blank href=ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/>ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/</a></ul>

<p>I am willing to install genomes from other sources as well, if they
are available in the genbank (.gbk) or EMBL (.embl) flat file
formats. The flat files must contain an annotated genome, i.e. a list
of features.

<br>An example of genbank file can be found at 
<ul><a target=_blank href=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/Escherichia_coli_K12/NC_000913.gbk>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/Escherichia_coli_K12/NC_000913.gbk</a></ul>

<p>A genome can correspond to one or several flat files. For examples,
the NCBI eucaryote distribution contains one flat file per chromosome.
<p><ul><a target=_blank
href=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae/>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae/</a></ul>

<p>If you want to add a genome to RSAT, please check if this genome is
distributed in Genbank or EMBL flat file format, and then send me te
URL from whicch the .gbk or .embl files can be downloaded.

</ul><h3>I cannot find my gene(s)</h3><ul>

<h4>Question</h4>
I am trying to retrieve sequences from the genome of <i>Myorg
sp.</i>, and for some genes (XXX, YYY and ZZZ), the progrm returns the
following message:

<ul><pre>
;WARNING	invalid query XXX
;WARNING	invalid query YYY
;WARNING	invalid query ZZZ
</pre></ul>

Am I using the wrong names for these genes?  Can you help?
</i>

<h4>Answer</h4>
Genomes are parsed from the NCBI distribution :

<ul><a target=_blank href=ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/</a></ul>


<p>
Please check if your genes are correctly annotated at NCBI ? This is
generally the reason why genes are not identified on the RSAT server.

<p>
In case your gene names would be annotated in the NCBI files and not
in RSAT, please contact me and I will try to fix the problem. If the
info is missing from the NCBI files, you should contact them.

<p>
If the genes are not there, you could have a look at the EMBL genome
distribution.

<ul><a target=_blank href=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/>
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/genomes/</a></ul>

<p>
EMBL an Genbank/NCBI are supposed to be synchronized, but for some
reason, their genome annotations (and in particular gene names) are
not. It is frequent that some genes are annotated at Genbank, whilst
some other at EMBL (fortunately, there is <i>some</i> overlap).

</ul><h3>Patser and consensus</h3><ul>

<h4>Question</h4>

Is it possible to obtain an installable version of PATSER? I'd like to
run it on a Linux box (at command line) to scan (eukaryotic)
chromosome-length sequences. Thanks.

<h4>Answer</h4>

The programs <i>patser</i> and <i>consensus</i> was developed by Jerry Hertz, and is available on his web site: 

<ul><a href=ftp://beagle.colorado.edu/pub/Consensus/>ftp://beagle.colorado.edu/pub/Consensus/</a></ul>


</ul><h3>Sequence purging</h3><ul>

<h4>Question</h4>
<i>I am working on finding common motifs located in upstream of co-regulated
genes in bacteria. Some software (and you) recommends masking or filtering
repeated sequences before pattern discovering. I am worry about losing some
binding sites by filtering.  I may not understand the meaning of repeated
sequences. So could please explain me this point or recommend some lectures
illustrated with examples. Thanks for your help. </i>

<h4>Answer</h4>

<p>Redundant sequences can occur for different reasons. Some examples:
<ul>
<li>50% of the human genomes is made of repetitive sequences (e.g. Alu, SINE, ...) which are probably not involved in regulation
<li> in yeast, telomeric regions contain many recent duplications, where a gene can be found in several almost identicak copies, including its promoter
<li>when you have two neighbour genes in opposite and divergent directions (one on the direct, one on the reversee strand), they sharee the same promoter
</ul>

<p>For this type of reasons, your set of upstream sequences could
contain large duplicated fragments.

<p>If this is the case, every single word of these duplicated segments
will be found in several copies, not because it is involved in
regulation but because the data set is redundant (the same sequence
has been taken multiple times). Thus, the motif discovery programs
will over-estimate its significance, and you will obtain a lot of
false positives in your motifs.

<p>My recommendation (and the default options of the web site)  is
<ul>
<li>for motif discovery, use the "purge" function, which masks all the duplicated segments
<li>for pattern matching, use the non-masked sequences, because you want to see he regulatory motifs in all the promoters, even if they are at the same position. 
</ul>

<p>As an exampe, you could try the following cluster (Y', from Spellman 1998)
<pre>
YBL112C
YBL113C
YEL073C
YEL075C
YEL077C
YFL046C
YFL066C
YFL067W
YGR296W
YLL067C
YLR446W
YLR463C
YPR202W
YBL111C
YEL076C-A
YER189W
YER190W
YFL065C
YHL049C
YHL050C
YHR218W
YHR219W
YIL177C
YJL225C
YLL066C
YLR462W
YLR464W
YLR467W
YNL339C
YPR203W
YPR204W
</pre>

<p>Try oligo-analysis with the upstream sequences, with and without purging respectively. 
<ul>
<li>without purging, you get a lot of motifs, which cover almost all the sequences (see the feature-map). These motifs are artifactual: they do not reflect regulation but redundancy of whole sequences in the data set
<li>without purging, you get no motif (apparently this group contains no significant motif).  
</ul>


</ul><h3>Analyzing larger dyads</h3><ul>

<h4>Question</h4>

<i>How is it possible to set the oligonucleotide size in dyad-analysis to 4 instead of 3?</i>

<h4>Answer</h4>


This option is not available on the web interface, because the time of
computation increases exponentially with the oligonucleotide length.
In my epxerience, the analysis of spaced pairs of trinucleotides is
generally sufficient to return larger motifs as well, because if there
is a pair of tetranucleotides, it is detected as multiple pairs of
mutually overlapping trinucleotides. For example

<ul><pre>
TAGT......ACTA
</pre></ul>

Can be detected in the following form :

<ul><pre>
TAG........CTA
TAG.......ACT.
.AGT.......CTA
</pre></ul>

But this depends on the sequence type. If you really need to analyse
pairs of 4nt or llarge, one possibility is to install a local version
of your computer. For this, you need a unix machine, and some
xperience with the unix system.

If you wish to download the unix version of the tools, you can find the licence and user instruction on the web site:
