\chapter{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Using the tool the tool \program{network randomization},
  generate two random graphs of 1000 nodes and 1000 arcs each (you
  will need to store these random networks on your hard drive).  Use
  the tool \program{network comparison} to compare the two random
  graphs.
  Discuss the result, including the following questions: 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the size of the intersection ? Does it correspond to
    the expected value ? 
  \item Which P-value do you obtain ? How do you interpret this P-value ? 
  \end{enumerate}

\item Randomize Ito's network with the tool \program{network
    randomization}, and compare this randomized graph with Uetz'
  network. Discuss the result in the same way as for the previous
  exercise.

\end{enumerate}
