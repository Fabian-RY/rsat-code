Virtual machine for the IFB cloud.

DESCRIPTION


This Virtual Machine enables to start an instance of the Regulatory
Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT; http://rsat.eu/) with support for only
two model organisms: the bacteria Escherichia coli K12, and the
budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Most tools are supported except:

- retrieve-ensembl-seq , because I still have a problem with the WS
  stubb 

- phylogenetic footprint tools because they require to install a
  sufficient number of genomes, which would take too much place for
  this VM.
