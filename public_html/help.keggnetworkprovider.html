<h4><a name="description">Description</a></h4>

<ul>
    The KEGG network provider allows the construction of bipartite metabolic networks specific to a set of organisms. 
    The networks are constructed from <a href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/xml/" target="_blank">KEGG KGML</a> files (KEGG version 46.0). Compounds and reactions are represented
    as separate node sets.<br> 
    It is also possible to filter the network in order to exclude certain reactions, compounds or reactant pair classes.  
    In addition, compounds and reactions in the constructed networks can be annotated with their label or EC number.<br>
    It is of note that KGML files do not list the side compounds of reactions. These will consequently be missing
    from the constructed metabolic network as well.
    <br>
</ul>

<h4><a name="input">Input</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li>KEGG organism abbreviations<br>
		Organisms present in KEGG can be specified by their KEGG abbreviation. If you want to specify more than one organism,
		you can separate organism identifiers by '/' (e.g. eco/sce).
		Note that the reference pathways can be requested with 'reference'.
		The list of KEGG organisms and their abbreviations in KEGG is available <a href="published_data/Kegg_organisms_list.txt">here</a>.
	</li>
	<li>KEGG organism file<br>
		Instead of or in addition to specifying organisms manually, a file with organism KEGG abbreviations can be up-loaded. The file contains
		one organism code on each line. Comment lines in the file should be preceded by '#'.
	</li>
	<li>KEGG reactions<br>
		In addition to or instead of KEGG organisms, KEGG reactions can be specified. The graph will be constructed from the
		specified reactions. The reactions should be separated by '/' (e.g. R00015/R00551).
	</li>
	<li>KEGG reaction file<br>
		Instead of or in addition to manually specifying KEGG reactions, a file can be provided, which contains one KEGG reaction by line.
		Comment lines in this file should be preceded by '#'.
	</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="options">Options</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Exclusion of KEGG compounds<br>
	Optionally, a set of KEGG compounds can be excluded from the network to be constructed. KEGG compound identifiers should
	be separated by '/' (e.g. C00001/C00002/C00010).
	</li>
	<li>Exclusion of KEGG reactions<br>
	Optionally, a set of KEGG reactions can be excluded from the network to be constructed. KEGG compound identifiers should
	be separated by '/' (e.g. R000259/R04453).
	</li>
	<li>Exclusion of KEGG RPAIR classes<br>
	Optionally, certain RPAIR classes can be excluded from network construction. Reactant pairs (RPAIRS) in KEGG are divided
	in five classes: main, trans, cofac, ligase and leave. 
	Excluding ligase or leave reactant pairs may improve path finding accuracy.
	If you want to exclude more than one RPAIR class, separate them by '/' (e.g. leave/ligase/cofac).
	</li>
	<li>Directed network<br>
	By default, undirected metabolic networks are constructed. However, in metabolic pathfinding, it is useful to represent
	reactions by separate nodes for the forward and reverse direction respectively. If "directed network" is selected, 
	the constructed network is directed, but contains for each forward reaction direction its reverse.
	</li>
	<li>RPAIR network<br>
	For the description of RPAIR networks see the <a href="http://rsat.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/metabolicpathfinding/help.metabolicPathfinder.html#graphtype">metabolic Pathfinder</a>.
	If "RPAIR network" is selected, a metabolic network containing reactant pairs instead of reactions is constructed.
	</li>
	<li>Attributes<br>
	A number of attributes can be set on the nodes of the metabolic network. By default, the following attributes are set:<br>
		<ul>
		<li>ObjectType: The ObjectType allows to differentiate between reaction and compound nodes.</li>
		<li>ExclusionAttribute: Forward and reverse direction of the same reaction share a common value for the ExclusionAttribute,
		which allows to treat them as mutually exclusive.</li>
		<li>Exclusion.Group (RPAIR network only): Its value is a set of all reactant pairs sharing a common reaction with the given reactant pair.</li>
		<li>RPAIRS.Linkage.Type (RPAIR network only): It has as its value the set of RPAIR classes to which a given reactant pair - compound interaction belongs.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		In addition, the following attributes can be set:
		<ul>
		 <li>EC numbers: The EC numbers associated to the KEGG reaction or reactant pair.</li>
		 <li>Label: The name of a KEGG compound.</li>
		 <li>Reaction equation: The equation of a KEGG reaction (not available for reactant pairs).</li>
		 <li>Formula: The formula of KEGG compounds.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="output">Output</a></h4>
 <ul>Network format<br>
 The network can be constructed in different formats.
 See the <a href="http://rsat.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/metabolicpathfinding/help.metabolicPathfinder.html#graphformat">metabolic Pathfinder</a> for details.
 Warning: The next step panel is only available for gml and tab-delimited graph formats. However, the next step panel allows to convert
 the network in dot or VisML.
 </ul>

<h4><A NAME="email"></A><b>Email</b></h4>
	<ul>You can optionally specify an email address, so KEGG network provider results can be sent to you by email.
		This is recommended if you specify a large number of organisms.
		If you leave the email field empty, results will be displayed in the browser.
	</ul>

<h4><A NAME="next">Next steps panel</a></h4>
	<ul>The next steps panel allows you to input the result of KEGG network provider into one of the listed tools without copy-pasting
	the result into that tool. The next steps panel will only appear if you choose gml or tab-delimited as network format.
	</ul>


<h4><A NAME="webservice">Web service</a></h4>
	<ul>In contrast to other tools in RSAT/NeAT, KEGG network provider has been implemented in Java for historical reasons
	and runs as axis web service. Therefore, clients have to call the wsdl file located at<br>
	<a href='http://rsat.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/be.ac.ulb.bigre.graphtools.server/wsdl/GraphAlgorithmsNeAT.wsdl' target='_blank'>http://rsat.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/be.ac.ulb.bigre.graphtools.server/wsdl/GraphAlgorithmsNeAT.wsdl</a> and not the one of RSAT/NeAT.
	This wsdl file has the same format as the one of RSAT and clients can be written
	the same way as for RSAT. The only change required is for the address of the wsdl file.
	WSDL documentation is available <a href='http://rsat.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/be.ac.ulb.bigre.graphtools.server/wsdl/GraphAlgorithms_documentation.xml'>here</a>.
	An example client in Java can be downloaded from <a href='http://www.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/Users/karoline/graphtoolsdemo.zip'>here</a>.
	</ul>

<h4><A NAME="standalone">Standalone tool</a></h4>
	<ul>A stand alone version of KEGG network provider is available <a href="http://www.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/Users/karoline/Graphtools.zip">here</a>.
