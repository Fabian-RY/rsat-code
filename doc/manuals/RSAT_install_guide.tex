\chapter{Introduction}

This documents describes the installation procedure for the software
suite \textbf{Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools} (\RSAT), which
integrates several dozens of tools to detect cis-regulatory elements
in DNA sequences
\cite{Thomas-Chollier:2011:W86-91,Thomas-Chollier:2008:W119-27,vanHelden:2003:3593-6,vanHelden:2000:177-87}.

\chapter{Quick installation guide}

The full installation of all the \RSAT functionalities requires some
external libraries and companion programs. Some installation steps are
tricky, because they depend on the operating system. However, the
majority of the tools does not require a full installation.

In order to give you a quick start, this section proposes a simplified
installation procedure.

The detailed installation instructions willl be presented in the next
chapters. In case of trouble, don't hesitate to contact
\href{mailto:me@example.com}{Jacques.van-Helden@univ-amu.fr}.

\section{Requirements}

Make sure that the following programs are installed on your machine.

\begin{itemize}
\item \program{tar}
\item \program{git}
\item \program{cvs}
\item \program{wget}
\item \program{perl} version 5.14 or later
\end{itemize}


\section{Basic installation steps}


\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Download} the compressed tar archive from the \RSAT
  distribution site, and uncompress it.

  \begin{lstlisting}
tar -xpzf rsat_yyyymmdd.tar.gz
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  
\item Open a terminal, set your working directory to the \file{rsat}
  folder extracted from this archive, and run the \RSAT
  \textbf{configuration script}.

  \begin{lstlisting}
cd rsat; 
perl perl-scripts/configure_rsat.pl
  \end{lstlisting}

  \textbf{Tip:} at this stage, the way to specify some parameters
  might seem obscure to you (e.g. URL of your web site, cluster
  parameters, NeAT, pathway tools, paths for helper
  programs). Actually these parameters are only required for the full
  installation of a web- and cluster-enabled \RSAT instance. 

  If you don't know how to specify a parameter, just leave it to its
  default value. You will have the possibility to re-run the
  configuration script later.

\item Define RSAT environment variable and adapt your path

  \begin{lstlisting}
source RSAT_config.bashrc
  \end{lstlisting}

Check the RSAT environment variable

  \begin{lstlisting}
echo $RSAT
  \end{lstlisting}

\item Include RSAT parameters in your default bash config.

For future sessions, include the following line in your bash
configuration file (\file{\$HOME/.bashrc} or, even better,
\file{/etc/bashrc} if you have admin rights on the machine).

\begin{verbatim}
source [RSAT_FULL_PATH]/RSAT_config.bashrc
\end{verbatim}


Note: for Ubuntu distribution , the simplest solution is to create a
soft link from the directory \file{/etc/profile.d/}. This requires
admin rights.

\begin{verbatim}
sudo ln -s $RSAT/RSAT_config.bashrc /etc/profile.d/rsat.sh
\end{verbatim}

\item \textbf{Initialize \RSAT folders}

  \begin{lstlisting}
make -f makefiles/init_rsat.mk init
  \end{lstlisting}
  
\item Install the required Perl libraries. For this you need admin
  rights.

  \begin{lstlisting}
## The following commands should be executed with admin rights.
sudo bash

## Check that RSAT path has been defined
echo $RSAT

## If not, try this and check again
##   source /etc/profile.d/rsat.sh

## Set working directory to RSAT
cd $RSAT

## Get the list of Perl modules to be installed
make -f makefiles/install_rsat.mk  perl_modules_list

## Check which Perl modules are already installed
make -f makefiles/install_rsat.mk perl_modules_check
## The locations of installed modules are stored in perl_modules_check.txt

## Install these modules
make -f makefiles/install_rsat.mk perl_modules_install
  \end{lstlisting}


  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Beware: } this step requires admin rights (you will be
    prompted for sudo password in order to install modules in cpan).
    
  \item \program{cpan} installation takes some time, and is
    interrupted by many prompts to let you choose some installation
    options. We recommend to use the default option for all questions
    (just press the ``Enter'' key). If you are bored to confirm each
    installation step, you can run the following target, which will
    automatically blindly accept all the default options.

\begin{lstlisting}
    make -f makefiles/install_rsat.mk perl_modules_install_noprompt
\end{lstlisting}
    
  \item Even though some Perl modules may fail to install, don't worry
    too much. At this stage, you should be able to use most of \RSAT
    functionalities.
  \end{itemize}

\item compile \RSAT programs written in C

\begin{lstlisting}
make -f makefiles/init_rsat.mk compile_all
\end{lstlisting}

\item Install some third-party programs required by some \RSAT
  scripts.

\begin{lstlisting}
make -f makefiles/install_software.mk install_ext_apps
\end{lstlisting}


\item Install two model organisms, required for some of the Web tools.

  \begin{lstlisting}
download-organism -v 1 -org Saccharomyces_cerevisiae
download-organism -v 1 -org Escherichia_coli_K_12_substr__MG1655_uid57779
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  Optionally, you can download additional organisms with the same
  command. The list of supported-organisms can be obtained with the
  command \program{supported-organisms-server}.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Testing the basic installation}

At this stage, you should now dispose of a local installation of \RSAT
with all the basic functionalities enabled. We can now test the proper
functioning of the different types of programs.

\subsection{Testing the path}

\subsubsection{RSAT envionment variable}

\begin{lstlisting}
echo $RSAT
\end{lstlisting}
%$

\subsubsection{RSAT exec dirs in the PATH}

Check that the folders containing RSAT executables are included in
your path.

\begin{lstlisting}
echo $PATH | perl -pe 's|:|\n|g' | grep rsat
\end{lstlisting}

The result should contain the full path to the folders \file{bin},
\file{perl-scripts}, and \file{python-scripts}.

\subsubsection{Testing a \RSAT Perl script}

Test a simple Perl script that does not require organisms to be
installed.

\begin{lstlisting}
random-seq -l 100 -n 2
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Testing a \RSAT python script}

Test a simple python script that does not require organisms to be
installed.

\begin{lstlisting}
random-motif -l 10 -c 0.90
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Testing a compiled C program}

\begin{lstlisting}
random-seq -l 1000 -n 100  | count-words -v 1 -1str
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Testing external programs}

\program{vmatch}

The program \program{vmatch} is an precious companion to \RSAT
discovery tools (\program{oligo-analysis}, \program{dyad-analysis},
\program{position-analysis}, \program{local-word-analysis}).

It requires a freeware license (\url{http://www.vmatch.de/}).

\begin{lstlisting}
random-seq -l 100 -n 1  | purge-sequence
\end{lstlisting}

If you get an error message, see section \ref{sect:install_vmatch} of
this manual.


\program{seqllogo}

The program \program{seqlogo} is used to draw logos from
position-specific scoring matrices. It is required for several \RSAT
tools (\program{convert-matrix}, \program{peak-motifs},
\program{matrix-clustering}, \program{footprint-discovery}, \ldots).

\begin{lstlisting}
## Locate the path of seqlogo
which seqlogo

## get the help for seqlogo
seqlogo

## ghostscript
which gs
gs --version
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Testing supported organisms}

Get the list of organisms supported on your computer.

\begin{lstlisting}
supported-organisms
\end{lstlisting}

Get the list of organisms supported on the server
\url{http://rsat.eu/}. This script requires some Perl libraries for
the SOAP/WSDL protocol. If it works, it means that you are ready to
use \RSAT Web services.

\begin{lstlisting}
supported-organisms-server -v 2 -server http://rsat.eu/ \
   -o supported_on_rsat_eu.tab ; 
wc -l  supported_on_rsat_eu.tab
\end{lstlisting}

Get the list of organisms supported on another server
\url{http://rsat.fr/}.

\begin{lstlisting}
supported-organisms-server -server http://rsat.fr/ \
   -o supported_on_rsat_fr.tab ; 
wc -l  supported_on_rsat_fr.tab
\end{lstlisting}


\chapter{Full installation}

The full installation of \RSAT sowftare suite includes some additional steps.

You should read this chapter only if you want to enable some of the
following functionalities:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item programs complementary to \RSAT, developed by other teams
  \item local Web server
  \item Web services
  \item distributed computing on a cluster (or on multiple processors
    of a single computer)
  \item metabolic pawthay analysis tools
\end{enumerate}

\section{Installing third-party programs}

\subsection{vmatch and mkvtree}
\label{sect:install_vmatch}

The programs \program{vmatch} and \program{mkvtree} are required by
the \RSAT progam \program{purge-sequence}, which plays an important
role to discard redundant sequences before running motif discovery
algorithms (\program{oligo-analysis}, \program{dyad-analysis},
\program{position-analysis}, \program{local-word-analysis}).

A free academic license can be obtained at Stefan Kurt's web page:

\url{http://www.vmatch.de/}

After having obtained the licence, install the 3 following files in
the \file{\$RSAT/bin} folder: \file{vmatch}, \file{mkvtree},
\file{vmatch.lic}.

Quick test for the correct functioning of \program{purge-sequence}:

\begin{lstlisting}
retrieve-seq -org Saccharomyces_cerevisiae -q GAL1 -q GAL10 -noorf \
  | purge-sequence
\end{lstlisting}

The second sequence (GAL10) should be masked (replaced by ``n''),
because GAL10 and GAL1 shar the same promoter (the genes are
transcribed in opposite direction).

\subsection{Other third-pary programs}

Some additional freeware programs are required for some particular
tasks in \RSAT. The list of these programs can be obtained as follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
make -f makefiles/install_software.mk list_ext_apps
\end{lstlisting}

Calling the makefile with the target \option{install\_ext\_apps} will
start the automatic installation of all these programs. 

\begin{lstlisting}
make -f makefiles/install_software.mk install_ext_apps
\end{lstlisting}

Note: for some programs, you may be prompted for the sudo password,
depending on the configuration you entered in the previous step (with
the script \file{configure\_rsat.pl}).

In case of trouble, try to install the programs one by one by calling
separately each target listed by \option{list\_ext\_apps}.

\include{ig_apache_config}

\subsection{Activating web services on your \RSAT instance}

By default, Web services requests are redirected towards the main
\RSAT server. To configure your \RSAT instance as a Web services
provider, you first need to update the WSDL file, which provides all
technical information about supported web services.

  \begin{lstlisting}
cd $RSAT ;
make -f makefiles/init_rsat.mk ws_init
  \end{lstlisting}

This will also display the parameters of your local web services,
which depend on the variable RSAT\_WWW when you ran the \RSAT
configuration script (\file{perl-scripts/configure\_rsat.pl}). Check
that these parameters are correct.

After this, you should generate the web services stubb, with the
following command.

  \begin{lstlisting}
make -f makefiles/init_rsat.mk ws_stubb
  \end{lstlisting}

You can test if the web services are working.

  \begin{lstlisting}
make -f makefiles/init_rsat.mk ws_stubb_test
  \end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Description and requirements}

\section{Description}


\section{Requirements}

\subsection{Operating system}

\RSAT is a unix-based software suite. It has been installed
successfully on the following operating systems.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Linux

\item Mac OSX (latest version tested: 10.8.3)

\item Sun Solaris

\item Dec Alpha

\end{enumerate}

\RSAT is not compatible with any version of Microsoft Windows and we
have no intention to make it compatible in a foreseeable future.

\subsection{Perl language}

Most of the programs in \RSAT are written in Perl. Version 5.1 or
later is recommended. A set of Perl modules is required, the \RSAT
package includes a script to install them automatically (see
Chapter~\ref{chap:perl_modules}).

\subsection{Python language}

Some of the programs in \RSAT are written in Python. 

Python release
2.7\footnote{\url{http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7/}} is
recommended, because it contains some required libraries for remote
access to external resources (UCSC genome browser).

The following Python libraries are required for various programs.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{setuptools}\footnote{\url{http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools}}
  is required to install other Python libraries (see installation
  instructions\footnote{\url{http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools\#installation-instructions}}).

\item \textbf{suds}\footnote{\url{https://fedorahosted.org/suds/}} is
  used for accessing the SOAP interface.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Helper applications}



\subsubsection{wget}

The program \program{wget}, is used  to download
\begin{enumerate}

\item some helper programs developed by third-parties, which can be
  installed in \RSAT;

\item genomes from the \RSAT server to your local \RSAT installation.

\end{enumerate}

\program{wget} is part of linux distribution. If it is not installed
on your computer, you can download it from
\url{http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/}.  An installation package for
Mac OSX can be found at
\url{http://download.cnet.com/Wget/3000-18506_4-128268.html}.


\subsubsection{gnuplot}

The standard version of the \RSAT program \program{XYgraph} export
figures in bitmapformat (png, jpeg). If you want to support vectorial
drawings (pdf), which give a much better resolution for printing, you
need to install the freeware software \program{gnuplot} (4.2 or
later), which can be downloaded from \url{http://www.gnuplot.info/}.


\subsubsection{git (only for developers)}

For co-developers of the \RSAT suite, the code is distributed program
\program{git}. For external users, there is no need to use
\program{git} since the code is distributed as a compressed archive on
a Web page.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Installation
\chapter{Obtaining \RSAT distribution}

For the time being, \RSAT is distributed as a compressed archive. 

The license can be obtained from the \RSAT web site (\rsaturl).

\section{Installation from a compressed archive}

Download the latest version of the \RSAT distribution. Uncompress the
archive containing the programs. The archive is distributed
\texttt{tar} format. The \texttt{.tar.gz} file can be uncompressed
with the command \program{tar}, which is included in most Unix
distributions.

\begin{lstlisting}
tar -xpzf rsat_yyyymmdd.tar.gz
\end{lstlisting}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The section about CVS has been moved to a separate file ig_cvs.tex,
%% and is not displayed anymore for two reasons: 
%% (1) the CVS distribution is reserved to RSAT team members.
%% (2) We are in the process to move from CVS to GIT. 
%%
%% \input{ig_cvs}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%M initialization
\chapter{Initializing \RSAT}

% \input{ug_configuration.tex}

\subsection{Configuring your \RSAT\ server}

RSAT requires to specify a set of parameters, which will be stored in
three property files:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  \file{RSAT\_config.props}
\item  \file{RSAT\_config.mk}
\item  \file{RSAT\_config.bashrc}
\end{enumerate}

In particular, \emph{it is crucial to specify the full path of the
  variable RSAT}, which specifies the RSAT main directory.

The simplest way to update the configuration file is to run the
following script.

\begin{lstlisting}
## Enter in RSAT distribution folder
cd rsat

## Run the configuration script
perl perl-scripts/configure_rsat.pl
\end{lstlisting}

Alternatively, you can edit the files with a text editor of your
choice.

\subsection{Loading RSAT environment variables}

The configuration script has created a bash file
\file{RSAT\_config.bashrc} in the \RSAT distribution directory (folder
\file{rsat}). 

This file should be loaded each time you enter a session. There are
several alternative ways to do this.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Source the file manually at each new session

\begin{lstlisting}
## Load the RSAT environment variables
source RSAT_config.bashrc
\end{lstlisting}

\item Copy the content of this file in the bash configuration file in
  your home directory (\file{~/.bashrc} or
  \file{~/.bash\_profile}). \RSAT environment variables will then be
  loaded for you at each connexion.

\item If you dispose of admin rights, you can copy the content of this
  file in the main bash configuration file: 
  \begin {itemize}
  \item in Lunix Centos, you can create a file
    \file{/etc/profile.d/rsat.bashrc}; 
  \item Mac OSX, copy it to the main bashrc file (\file{/etc/bashrc}).
  \end{itemize}
  \RSAT environment variables will then be automatically loaded for
  each user of this computer.
\end{enumerate}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Directories

\section{Initializing the directories}

In addition to the programs, the installation of rsat requires
the creation of a few directories for storing data, access logs (for
the web server), and temporary files.

The distribution includes a series of make scripts which will
facilitate this step. You just need go to the rsat directory, and
start the appropriate make file.

\begin{lstlisting}
cd $RSAT ; 
make -f makefiles/init_rsat.mk init
\end{lstlisting}
% $

%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% % Config file
%% \section{Adapting \RSAT \  local configuration}


%% \subsection{Creating site-specific configuration files}

%% The \RSAT distribution comes with two template configuration files
%% located in the \file{rsat} directory:

%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item \file{RSAT\_config\_default.props} 
%% \item \file{RSAT\_config\_default.mk}
%% \end{itemize}

%% During the initialization script executed in the previous section,
%% these two default files were automatically copied to your
%% site-specific configuration files \file{RSAT\_config.props} and
%% \file{RSAT\_config.mk}.

%% Check this before going any further: 

%% \begin{lstlisting}
%% ls -1 RSAT_config*
%% \end{lstlisting}

%% You should see this:
%% \begin{verbatim}
%% RSAT_config_default.mk
%% RSAT_config_default.props
%% RSAT_config.mk
%% RSAT_config.props
%% \end{verbatim}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Check the RSAT paths
\subsection{Checking the RSAT path}

The \RSAT programs should now be included in your path.  To check if
this is done properly, just type:

\begin{lstlisting}
random-seq -l 350
\end{lstlisting}

If your configuration is correct, this command should return a random
sequence of 350 nucleotides.

Don't worry if you see a warning looking like this:

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
; WARNING	The tabular file with the list of supported organism cannot be read
; WARNING	Missing file	[RSAT_PARENT_PATH]/rsat/public_html/data/supported_organisms.tab
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

This warning will disappear as soon as you download the first organism
in \RSAT.


\chapter{Installing Perl modules}
\label{chap:perl_modules}

Some Perl modules are required for the graphical tools of \RSAT, and
for some other specific programs. The perl modules can be found in the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (\url{http://www.cpan.org/}), or
can be installed with the command \program{cpan}.

\section{Before installing Perl modules: install the GD library}

The Perl module \program{GD.pm} requires prior installation of the
\program{GD} library.

\begin{itemize}

\item On \emph{Linux} systems, this library can be installed with the
  package manager of the distribution. for example:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \program{apt-get} for Ubuntu
  \item  \program{yum} for Centos
  \item \program{yast} for Suze
  \item \ldots
  \end{itemize}
  
\item On \emph{Mac OSX} systems, the installation of the GD library
  can be done with the program \program{brew} (\url{http://brew.sh/}).

  After having installed brew, you can install the GD library in your
  system by typing.
  \begin{lstlisting}
brew install gd
\end{lstlisting}
   
  

%% First install libpng and libjpeg. Only then install the GD library. Here is an example that worked on OSX 10.8:
%% \begin{lstlisting}
%% curl -O http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v9.tar.gz
%% tar -xzvf jpegsrc.v9.tar.gz 
%% cd jpeg-9/
%% ./configure
%% make
%% sudo make install

%% curl -O ftp://ftp.simplesystems.org/pub/libpng/png/src/libpng15/libpng-1.5.16.tar.gz
%% tar -xvzf libpng-1.5.16.tar.gz 
%% cd libpng-1.5.16
%% ./configure
%% make
%% sudo make install

%% curl -O https://bitbucket.org/libgd/gd-libgd/downloads/libgd-2.1.0-rc1.tar.gz
%% tar -xvzf libgd-2.1.0-rc1.tar.gz
%% cd libgd-2.1.0-rc1
%% ./configure --with-png=/usr/local
%% \end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

\section{Automatic installation of Perl modules}

The simplest way to install all the required Perl modules is to tye
the command below. \emph{Beware:} this command sudo requires
administrator rights on the computer. If you don't have the root
password, please consult your system administrator.

\begin{lstlisting}
## Acquire the system administrator rights
sudo bash;

## Define the RSAT environment variable.
##
## You must replace [RSAT_PATH] by the full path to your rsat folder.
export RSAT=[RSAT_PATH]

## Check that the RSAT environment variable has been defined
echo $RSAT

## Check that the RSAT environment variable points towards the right directory
ls -1 $RSAT
## This should give you the list of the files and folders included in your rsat folder.

## Set your working directory to the rsat folder
cd $RSAT

## Display the list of Perl modules that will be installed
make -f makefiles/install_rsat.mk perl_modules_list;

## Print the command that will be used to install the Perl modules (just for checking)
make -f makefiles/install_rsat.mk perl_modules_cmd;

## Install the Perl modules
make -f makefiles/install_rsat.mk perl_modules_install;
\end{lstlisting}
%% closing $

Beware, \program{cpan} will frequently ask you to confirm the
installation steps. you should thus check the CPAN process and answer
"yes" at each prompt.

The following command enables to install all the Perl modules in a
somewhat risky, but less cumbersome way. It relies on the command
\program{yes} to automatically answer each question by a carriage
return, which will lead \program{cpan} to chose the default option.

\begin{lstlisting}
## Install the Perl modules
make -f makefiles/install_rsat.mk perl_modules_install;
\end{lstlisting}

In case some modules would not be properly installed with the above
commands, you can try installing them manually (the list of required
modules is listed in the next section).


\section{Additional Perl modules required to support EnsEMBL genomes}
\label{sect:ensembl_libraries}

This section is required only if you intend to use the \RSAT programs
interfaced to the Ensembl database.  Since 2008, a series of \RSAT
programs support a direct access to the EnsEMBL database in order to
ensure a convenient access to genomes from higher organisms
\cite{Sand:2009}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \program{supported-organisms-ensembl}
\item \program{ensembl-org-info}
\item \program{retrieve-ensembl-seq.pl} 
\item \program{get-ensembl-genome.pl}
\end{itemize}

Those programs require to install a few Perl libraries as well as a
MySQL client on your machine.

The first requirement is the \program{BioPerl} module, which has in
principle been installed in Chapter~\ref{chap:perl_modules}). The
MySQL client should also have been installed in
Chapter~\ref{chap:perl_modules}).

To obtain EnsEMBL \footnote{Full instructions at
  \url{http://useast.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_cvs.html}}.

\begin{lstlisting}

## Make sure you start from the right directory
cd $RSAT

## Display the parameters for installing Ensembl API (in particular,
## the version for Ensembl and EnsemblGenomes).
##
## Check the number of the latest release on the respective web sites. 
##   Ensembl: http://www.ensembl.org/index.html
##   EnsemblGenomes: http://ensemblgenomes.org/
make -f makefiles/install_software.mk install_ensembl_api_param

## Install the ensembl library
make -f makefiles/install_software.mk install_ensembl_api 

## Notes: you need to enter the following passwords for the CVS
## servers.
## - For Ensembl:  CVSUSER.
## - For bioperl:  cvs

\end{lstlisting}
%%$ 


Note that there may be incompatibilities between successive versions
of the Ensembl API. The install script includes a parameter
\texttt{ENSEMBL\_VERSION} to specify the version ("branch") of the
Ensembl API distribution.  Moreover, there are different release
numbers of the ``historical'' Ensembl database, and for the
EnsemblGenomes databases (Bacteria, Fungi, Plants, Metazoa).

In addition, there are dependencies between releases. So,
EnsemblGenomes 20 is compatible with Ensembl verison 73, whereas
Ensembl has already released its version 74. In order to install an
API compatible with Ensembl and EnsemblGenomes, we recommend always
check the latest releases of both databases on the EnsemblGenomes web
page (\url{http://www.ensemblgenomes.org/}), and adapt the following
command accordingly.

\begin{lstlisting}
## Install the ensembl library with a specific branch number.
make -f makefiles/install_software.mk install_ensembl_api \
   ENSEMBL_VERSION=73
\end{lstlisting}
%%$ 

The installation script will print out a series of modifications of
the PERL5LIB variable, that should be added to your bashrc file in
order to provide support for Ensembl Perl API.

You should also check the specification of ensembl paths in the props
file.

\begin{lstlisting}
ensembl=[RSAT_PARENT_PATH]/rsat/lib/ensembl/modules
compara=[RSAT_PARENT_PATH]/rsat/lib/ensembl-compara/modules
variation=[RSAT_PARENT_PATH]/rsat/lib/ensembl-variation/modules
\end{lstlisting}

You also need to define the URL of the Ensembl database in that
configuration file:

\begin{lstlisting}

\emph{Notes}: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item to access EnsEMBL versions above 47, you need port 5306 to be
  opened on your machine. This might require an intervention of your
  system administrator of your network in order to ensure that the
  Firewall accepts this port.
\end{enumerate}

Detailed information about the EnsEMBL libraries can be obtained on
the EnsEMBL web site
(\footnote{\url{http://www.ensembl.org/info/using/api/api\_installation.html}}).

%% Compile C/C++ programs
\chapter{Compiling C programs in \RSAT}

Some of the tools available in \RSAT (\program{info-gibbs},
\program{matrix-scan-quick}, \program{count-words}) are written in the
\program{C} language. The distribution only contains the sources of
these tools, because the binaries are operating system-dependent. The
programs can be compiled in a very easy way.

\begin{lstlisting}
cd $RSAT;
make -f makefiles/init_rsat.mk compile_all
\end{lstlisting}

This will compile and install the following programs in the directory
\file{\$RSAT/bin}. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Downloading genomes from RSAT main server

\input{ig_downloading_genomes.tex}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Tests for the command line tools
\input{ig_testing_config}


%% \section{Further steps}

%% The installation is now finished, you can start the user's guide.

%% In case you would like to install additional genomes that are not
%% supported on \RSAT main server, the next chapter indicates yiou how to
%% proceed.


\chapter{Installing third-party programs}

\section{Complementary programs for the analysis of regulatory
  sequences}

The \RSAT distribution only contains the programs developed by the
\RSAT team.

A few additional programs, developed by third parties, can optionally
be integrated in the package. All third-party programs may be loacated
in the directory \emph{bin} directory of the \RSAT distribution.  

In order to add functionalities to \RSAT, install some or all of these
programs and include their binaries path \file{\$RSAT/bin}. If you are
not familiar with the installation of unix programs, ask assistance to
your system administrator.

Some of those can be downloaded and installed automatically using the
makefile \file{install\_rsat.mk}. Before doing this, you must make
sure that the program \program{wget} (this program is supported on
Linux \urlref{http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/} and Mac OSX
\urlref{http://download.cnet.com/Wget/3000-18506_4-128268.html}
systems).

You can then run the following commands to install some of the
third-party programs that are complementary to \RSAT.

\begin{lstlisting}
cd $RSAT;
make -f makefiles/install_software.mk install_ext_apps
\end{lstlisting}
%$

Some other third-party programs will require a manual installation (in
particular, \program{vmatch} and \program{mkvtree}).


\begin{description}
\item[\program{vmatch} and \program{mkvtree}]: developed by Stefan
  Kurtz, are used by the program \program{purge-sequences}, to mask
  redundant sequences that bias motif discovery statistics.

\item[\program{seqlogo}]: developed by Thomas D. Schneider, is used
  used by the programs \program{convert-matrix},
  \program{compare-matrices}, \program{peak-motifs},
  \program{matrix-quality} and a few others, to generate
  logos. \program{seqlogo} is the command-line version of
  \program{WebLogo}\urlref{http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/}.

  Download the source code archive and uncompress it. Copy the
  following files to the directory \emph{bin} of your \RSAT
  distribution: \file{seqlogo}, \file{logo.pm}, \file{template.pm} and
  \file{template.eps}.

\item \program{seqlogo} requires a recent version of \program{gs}
  (ghostscript\urlref{http://www.ghostscript.com/}) to create PNG and
  PDF output, and \program{ImageMagic's
    convert}\urlref{http://www.imagemagick.org/} to create GIFs.

\item[matrix-based pattern discovery]: several third-party pattern
  discovery programs can be optionally called from some \RSAT task
  managers (e.g. \program{multiple-family-analysis},
  \program{peak-motifs}). 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \program{meme} (Tim Bailey)
  \item \program{consensus} (Jerry Hertz)
  \item \program{MotifSampler} (Gert Thijs)
  \item \program{gibbs} (Andrew Neuwald)
  \end{itemize}

  Their installation is not properly required for \RSAT functioning,
  but it may be convenient to install them in order to compare the
  results retured by alternative motif discovery approaches on the
  same data sets.

%\section{Recommended programs for the Network Analysis Tools (NeAT)}
%
%
%For the Network Analysis Tools (NeAT), we recommend to install the
%following programs, which offer complementary functionalities for the
%analysis of networks/graphs.
%
%Some programs come in the contrib directory of the \RSAT
%distribution. Some others have to be downloaded from their original
%distribution site.
%
%To compile the program \program{floydwarshall} located in the
%\file{contrib/floydwarshall} directory of \RSAT, use this command :
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%gcc $RSAT/contrib/floydwarshall/floydwarshall.c -o $RSAT/bin/floydwarshall
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%
%In addition, the contributed programs REA and kWalks need to be installed.
%
%To install kWalks, type:
%
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%cd $RSAT/contrib; 
%tar -xzvf kwalks/kwalks.tgz; 
%cd $RSAT/contrib/kwalks/src; 
%make clean; make
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%You can test taht the compilation worked by running the following
%command.
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%$RSAT/contrib/kwalks/bin/lkwalk
%\end{lstlisting}
%%% $
%
%This should display the help message of \program{lkwalk}.
%
%Check that the KWALKS\_ROOT variable in the RSAT config file
%(\file{\$RSAT/RSAT\_config.props}) points to the correct path (it
%should be the absolute path of \file{\$RSAT/contrib/kwalks/bin/}).
%
%To install REA, type:
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%cd $RSAT/contrib/REA; 
%tar xzvf REA.tgz; 
%rm -f *.o; 
%make
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%You can test taht the compilation worked by running the following
%command.
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%$RSAT/contrib/REA/REA
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%This should display the help message of \program{REA}.
%
%Check that the REA\_ROOT variable in the RSAT config file
%(\file{\$RSAT/RSAT\_config.props}) points to the correct path (it
%should be the absolute path of \file{\$RSAT/contrib/REA}).
