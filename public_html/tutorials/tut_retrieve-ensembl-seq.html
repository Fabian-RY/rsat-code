<br/>
In the left frame, under the title <B>Sequence retrieval</B>, click
on the tool "<B>retrieve EnsEMBL sequence</B>". A form appears, allowing you
to select the parameters of sequence retrieval.


<h3>Retrieving sequences for a selected set of genes</h3>
<ul>

We will first retrieve upstream sequences for a set of 4 human genes
involved in breast cancer.

<OL>

<p><li> In the pop-up menu "<B>Query organism</b>", select <I>Homo sapiens</I>

<p><li> In the text area under "<B>Gene, transcript or protein IDs</B>", type the following list
of IDs</LI>

<PRE>
ENSG00000139618
ENSG00000100916
ENSG00000110934
ENSG00000131507
</PRE>

<p><li> In the <b>From</b> box, under <b>Options for upstream or downstream
      sequence</b>, replace -2000 by -5000.


<p><li>Leave all other options unchanged and click on the button
<b>GO</b>

</OL>

<p>
After a few seconds, the result is displayed.<!--, in the form of a link to
the sequences, followed by a series of Buttons.

<p>The reason why sequences are not directly displayed is that users
usually don't need to see them, since they are retrieved for
subsequent analysis with other tools. This is particularly useful to
avoid transferring large amounts of data over the web when you are
analyzing large sequence sets (e.g. several hundreds of genes).  The
default output mode (in the retrieve-ensembl-seq form) is thus to maintain the
output on the <i><b>server</b></i>, rather than displaying them on
your browser window.

-->
<P>
Even if the server mode has been used, you still have the possibility
to check the sequences a posteriori. In the result page, click on the
link, in order to see the upstream sequence of the selected
genes. Check the sizes of the sequences obtained.

<p>Click on the <b>Back</b> button to come back to the previous result
page. Below the link, you can see a series of buttons, which will
allow you to send the retrieved sequences to the next task (as we will
see in the next tutorials). For the time being, do not click these
buttons.


<p><B>Remarks</B>

<ol>

<p><li>EnsEMBL IDs must be separated by carriage returns.

</ol>


</ul>
<h3>Preventing overlap with neighbour genes</h3>
<ul>

<ol>
<p><li>Come back to the <b>retrieve EnsEMBL sequence</b> form. 
<p><li>Perform the same operations as above, but this time, select
the option <b>Prevent overlap with neighbouring gene</b>.
<p><li>Compare the size of the sequences with the previous result. 
</ol>

</ul>
<h4>Interpretation of the results</h4>
<ul>

<p>
One of the genes has a neighbour gene closer than 5000 bp.


</ul>
