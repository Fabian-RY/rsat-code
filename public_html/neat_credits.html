</center>

<p>The Network Analysis Tools integrate a set of programs implemented
at the <a target=_blank href=http://www.bigre.ulb.ac.be>Laboratoire de
Bioinformatique des G&eacute;nomes et des R&ecaute;seaux (BiGRe)</a>,
plus a few programs developed by third parties (with the authorization
of their authors).</p>

<p>The authors are indicated in the manual pages of each tool.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The programs for handling graphs and clusters (conversion,
comparisons, display) were mainly developed by Sylvain Brohée and
Jacques van Helden. </p></li>

<li><p>The algorithms for path finding in metabolic networks were
principally developed by Fabian Couche, Didier Croes, and Karoline
Faust, under the supervision of Jacques van Helden.</p></li>
</ul>
