                        clustering
align.leaf.and.cluster
                        Align one single node with a cluster of
                        (already aligned) motifs.
align.motifs            Align all the motifs, using as base the merge
                        order of one hierarchical tree.
align.two.clusters      Align two already aligned clusters of motifs.
align.two.leaves        Align two single nodes.
alignment.test          Using a given agglomeration method, checks if
                        the clusters will be aligned.
build.distance.matrix   Build distance matrix from a motif comparison
                        table
closest.or.farthest.motifs.ids
                        Identify the "central" or farthest leaves
                        (motifs) between two clusters.
color.code.clusters     Assign one color to each cluster.
convert.hclust.to.JSON
                        Convert 'hclust' tree to Newick format
convert.hclust.to.newick
                        Convert 'hclust' tree to Newick format.
define.clusters.bottom.up
                        Traverse the tree in a bottom-up approach to
                        separate the motifs clusters.
draw.heatmap.motifs     Draw a heatmap of the input motifs, using the
                        same distance tab and the same aggolmeration
                        method.
fill.downstream         Add gaps to the downstream end of the consensus
get.comparison.number   Given two sets of IDs, return the number of
                        comparison from the given comparison table
get.comparison.numbers
                        Given two sets of IDs, return the number of
                        comparison from the given comparison table
get.consensus           Extract the motif IUPAC consensus (or its
                        reverse complement) from a reference table.
get.id                  Extract the id of a motif from a reference
                        table.
get.name                Extract the name of a motif from a reference
                        table.
get.spacer.nb           Counts the number of gaps ("-") in both ends of
                        a consensus string.
hclust.motifs           Hierarchical clustering of the motifs.
identify.JSON.tree.branches
                        Identify the order of the branches in the JSON
                        tree, relative to the order of one hclust tree.
inverted.alignment      Invert the aligned consensus and orientation
                        information for a group of aligned motifs.
leaves.per.node         Collect the nodes of each node of the tree.
oct4.tfbm.compa         Comparison matrix between 21 TFBM discovered by
                        RSAT peak-motifs in Oct4 ChIP-seq peaks
