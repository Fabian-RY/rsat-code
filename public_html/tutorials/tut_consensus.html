<a name=intro></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
In this tutorial, we will use consensus to discover motifs in the
upstream sequences of the MET family, as we did for the <a
href=tut_oligo-analysis.html>tutorial on oligo-analysis</a>.

</ul>
<a name=example></a><h2>Example of utilization</h2>
<ul>

We will retrieve the upstream sequence of a set of genes involved in
phosphate metabolism, and try to predict their regulatory motif with
consensus.

<p>
The two main parameters to estimate are the matrix width and the
expected number of sites. For the matrix width, you should sample
different possibilities, since some factors (like Pho4p) have a
binding core of 5-10 contiguous base pairs, whereas other factors
(like Gal4p) recognized a pair of trinucleotide, separated by a spacer
of fixed width but variable content (see the <a
href=tut_dyad-analysis.html>tutorial on dyad-analysis</a>).

<ol>
<p><li>Retrieve the upstream sequences of the PHO genes. Make sure to
<b>inactivate</b> the option <b>Prevent overlap with neighbour
genes</b>.

<ul><pre>
PHO5
PHO8
PHO11
PHO81
PHO84
</pre></ul>

<p><li>Send the resulting sequence to consensus by clicking on the
button <b>consensus</b> at the bottom of the result page. 

<p><li>In the consensus form, set the expected number of patterns to
10. This relies on the observation that, in yeast, there are often
between 1 and 3 binding sites for the same transcription factor per
upsteram sequence. Since there are 5 genes in our test, we set the
expected number of sites to 10. Two binding sites per gene is a
reasonable first guess for yeast regulons, but beware that this might
vary from organism to organism. 

<p><li>Leave all other parameters unchanged and click <b>GO</b>.

</ol>

<p>
After a few tens of seconds, you should see the result of this
analysis.

</ul>
<a name=interpret></a><h2>Interpreting the results</h2>
<ul>

<p>
The consensus outputs starts with a header, providing some description
of the parameters and data set. After the header, the programs returns
a set of matrices.

<p>
Each matrix represents the alignemnt of a set of sequence fragments,
whose size was specified in the consensus parameters.

<p>
By default, the program returns the 4 most significant matrices. These
matrices are often slight variants of the aame motif. With the PHO
family, the 4 matrices are centered on CACGTG, which is indeeed the
core of the Pho4p binding site.

<p>
The most informative statistics for estimating the significant of the
discovered matrices is the expected frequency. With the settings used
in the above example, we obtained an expected value of 0.07, which
indicates the number of matrices with a higher or equal significance
which would be obtained by chance alone.


</ul>
<a name=exercises></a><h2>Additional exercises</h2>
<ul>

<p>
<ol>

<p><li>Use consensus to predict regulatory elements in the GAL
regulon.

<pre>
GAL1
GAL2
GAL3
GAL7
GAL80
GCY1
</pre>

Note that you will need to sample different matrix width for detecting
the Gal4p motif (you can for exmple try 10, 20, 30, and 40). For each
matrix width, evaluate the significance of the result on the basis of
the expected frequency. Which matrix width gives the highest
significance ? Which motif is returned ? Does it contain to the Gal4p
consensus ?

<p><li>Select a random set of 10 yeast genes (with the program
<b>random-genes</b>, retrieve their upstream sequences (<b>without</b>
overlap with neighbour genes), and test this random selection with
consensus. Perform this test a few times, with different numbers of
random genes, and different settings. Examine the expected frequency
of the resulting matrices.
