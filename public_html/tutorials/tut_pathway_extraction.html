      <a name='intro'></a><hr><h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>We now dispose of the complete genome for more than 1,000
      Bacteria, and this number is expected to grow even faster with
      the advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods. For most
      of these bacteria, almost nothing is known about metabolism,
      regulation. These bacteria were sequenced because they present
      some interest for medicine, biotechnologies, agriculture, but
      they have not yet been characterized by geneticists or
      biochemists, and it is very likely that they will never be, just
      because there are not enough people and financial resources to
      perform all the required experiments. </p>
    
    <p>Bioinformatics is thus the most reasonable way to at least try
      understanding the composition of these genomes, the function of
      their genes, and the way they interact to allow an organism of
      interest to survive in its environment. The first annotation
      step consists in comparing the sequence of each gene product to
      a database of protein functions (e.g. <a target='_blank'
      href='http://www.uniprot.org'>Uniprot</a>), and to infer
      individual gene function by sequence similarity. </p>
    
    <p>Gene-wise analysis is however restricted to a one-by-one
      prediction, and does not inform us on how genes and proteins are
      integrated into complex processes. However, several predictive
      methods have been developed to address this question, in various
      ways.
      <ol>
	<p><li><b>Operon prediction</b>:. In Bacteria, genes involved
	    in the same process are often regrouped in operons
	    (defined here as poly-cistronic transcription
	    units). Genes belonging to the same operon are generally
	    separated by a very short intergenic space (less than
	    50bp) or can even overlap, since the stop codon of a gene
	    (<tt>TAA</tt>, <tt>TAG</tt>, <tt>TGA</tt>) can overlap
	    with the start codon (<tt>ATG</tt>) of the next gene in
	    two ways. Operons can be predicted with a reasonable
	    accuracy (~80%) by grouping genes separated by a distance
	    shorter than a given limit (e.g. 55bp), using a simplified
	    approach derived from Salgado et al., 2000;
	    Moreno-Hagelsieb et al., 2002.</li></p>
	<p><li><b>Inference of co-regulation networks and prediction
	      of regulons</b>. Transcription (single genes or operons)
	      involved in a same function are generally co-regulated
	      at the transcriptional level by some specific
	      transcription factor. For example, in <i>Escherichia
	      coli</i> enzymes involved in methionine biosynthesis are
	      regulated by the MetJ repressor, genes involved in
	      arginine biosynthesis by the ArgR repressor, and so
	      on. This regulation is relatively well conserved across
	      species, up to a given taxonomical level
	      (Gammaproteobacteria). We can predict the cis-regulatory
	      elements of a gene by detecting phylogenetic footprints,
	      i.e. sequence motifs that are conserved in the upstream
	      sequences of its orthologs (Janky and van Helden,
	      2008). We can further link genes having similar
	      footprints, in order to infer a co-regulation network
	      (Broh&eacute;e et al., 2011), and extract from this
	      network the modules of highly connected genes, which are
	      likely to reveal regulons. </li></p>
	<p><li><b>Prediction of metabolic pathways</b>. Starting from
	    a set of enzymes supposed to be involved in the same
	    process (e.g. found in a predicted operon or regulon), we
	    can identify the reactions they can catalyze, and apply
	    path finding methods (Croes et al.; 2005; 2006; Faust et
	    al., 2009a, 2009b) to find the link between pairs of
	    reactions. More interestingly, we can use this set of
	    reactions as seeds to extract a subgraph from the
	    reaction/compound network, in order to predict the
	    metabolic pathway that can be catalyzed by the products of
	    a given operon or regulon (Faust et al., 200. </li></p>
      </ol>
    </p>
    

    <a name='questions'></a><hr><h2>General goal and specific questions</h2>
    

    <p>The general goal of the tutorial is to learn the use of a
      series of bioinformatics tools to predict metabolic pathways and
      their regulation. More specifically, we would like to address
      the following question. </p>
    
    <ol>
      <p><li><b>Browsing EcoCyc</b>. The first step of the tutorial
	  will consists in selecting a pathway of interest, and
	  analyzing the corresponding annotation in the E.coli pathway
	  database EcoCyc. This will be considered as the reference
	  pathway for the subsequent steps. </li></p>

      <p><li><b>Two-ends path finding</b>. Can we recover our pathway
	  of interest by finding the shortest path between its start
	  and end compounds ?</li></p>

      <p><li><b>Operon prediction</b>. Are the genes of the pathway
	  regrouped in one or several operons, or are they scattered over
	  the genome ?</li></p>

      <p><li><b>Footprint discovery</b>. Using comparative genomics,
	  can we predict the cis-acting elements of the genes coding
	  for the enzymes involved in a pathway of interest ? How
	  widely are these elements conserved across the taxonomy ? Do
	  we detect similar conserved motifs (phylogenetic footprints)
	  in the promoters of different genes of our pathway of
	  interest ?
      </li></p>

      <p><li><b>Pathway extraction</b>. The distance based method
	  provides a quick and easy way to perform a rough prediction
	  of all the operons of a given genome. some operons will
	  contain a set of enzymes, supposedly involved in a common
	  metabolic pathway. If an operon contains several
	  enzyme-coding genes, can we predict the pathway catalyzed by
	  these enzymes ?
      </li></p>

    </ol>
    
    <p>In this tutorial, we will combine the Regulatory Sequence Analysis
      Tools (RSAT, <a target='_blank'
		      href='http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/'>http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/</a>)
      and Network Analysis Tools (NeAT, <a target='_blank'
					   href='http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/neat/'>http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/neat/</a>) to
      analyze metabolic pathways and their regulation.</p>
    
    <p>Each student will choose a different metabolic pathway as study
      case, and run various bioinformatics tools to analyze this pathway and
      its regulation. </p>

    <a name='ecocyc'></a><hr><h2>Browsing annotated pathways with EcoCyc</h2>
    
    <div class='tut'>
      <ol>
	<li>Open a connection to EcoCyc (<a target='_blank'
					    href='http://www.ecocyc.org/'>http://www.ecocyc.org/</a>)</li>
	<li>Enter the name of a pathway of interest (for example an
	  "Lysine biosynthesis") and follow the link to that
	  pathway. you should try to find a pathway with a sufficient
	  number of reaction steps (at least 4).</li>
	<li>By clicking on the button <i>More detail</i>, you can
	  obtain a progressively more refined view of the pathway,
	  with details about compound structure etc.</li>
	<li>Read carefully the record, and pay a particular attention
	  to the location of mapped genes and the genetic regulation
	  schematic.

	  <p><b>Note:</b> For the sake of this tutorial, you should
	  better use a pathway that is regulated at the
	  transcriptional level (e.g. methionine biosynthesis), or
	  whose genes are grouped in operons (e.g. histidine
	  biosynthesis). </li>

           and select the tool <b>Metabolic path finding</b>.
	</li>

	<li>Try to find the shorter path between the initial substrate
	  and end product of your study case pathway. For this, first
	  leave all options to their default values.
	  <br><b>Beware</b>:
	  the first step of the analysis returns the list of comounds
	  that match queries for the start and end compounds. Make
	  sure you select the rigth compound (e.g. L-apsartate and
	  L-lysine for the lysine biosynthesis pathway). </li>

	<li>Compare the predicted pathways with the reference pathway
	  (the one annotated in EcoCyc).</li>

	<li>Redo the analysis by changing the option <b>Graph type</b>
	  to <i>Reaction network (compounds and reactions)</i> </li>

	<li>Reset the option <b>Graph type</b> to <i> RPAIR network
	    (compounds and reactant pairs)</i>, and test the ipmpact
	    of the <b>Weighting scheme</b>. What happens when you
	    disable compound weighting ? </li>
