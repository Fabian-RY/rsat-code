Any non trivial formal system will either fail to capture all truths in the portion of the real world it is designed to model or will contain some false statement. It is impossible to design a formal system to contain all true statements and no false statements.<BR>

<P>

The release of the complete genomic sequence from the yeast <I>Saccharomyces
cerevisiae</I> not only provided a huge amount of new data for the molecular
biologist, but also impulsed the development of new computational techniques
required for the analysis of these data. Most informatic tools currently
available were conceived essentially for the analysis of coding sequences.
Non-coding sequences present however a striking interest since they govern
the regulation of gene expression. This site offers a series of tools dedicated
to the analysis of upstream regions from the yeast <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I>.
Several tools are nevertheless of wider interest and can be used for non-yeast
and non-reguatory sequence.
<P>Each tool is presented as a form to fill. For each form, a help page
provides detailed information about the parameters. To get familiar with
the tools, we recommend you to follow the <B><A HREF="tutorial.html">tutorial</A></B>.
