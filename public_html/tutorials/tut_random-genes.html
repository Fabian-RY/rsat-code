<a name=prerequisite></a><h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<ul>

This tutorial does not require any prior knowledge, but in order to
take the maximal benefit of it, you should first follow the tutorials
on 
<a href=tut_retrieve-seq.html>sequence retrieval</a> and 
<a href=tut_oligo-analysis.html>oligo-analysis</a>.

</ul>
<a name=intro></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>

<p>In the context of transcriptome analysis, we are confronted with
huge amounts of data, which can be processed in different ways to
obtain clusters of co-expressed genes. A routine approach perform
clustering on gene expression profiles, and to use a motif discovery
program to each cluster of genes, in order to predict their specific
regulatory elements.

<p>It is well knwon that microarray data is noisy, and, in addition,
there are dozens of ways to post-process this data (choice of a
normalization method, fitering of , clustering algorithm, distance
metrics, other clustering options, ...). It is thus expected that many
of our supposedly "co-expressed" genes will be artifactual, resulting
from all the possible biases of the data treatments, and will actually
not correspond to a set of co-regulated genes (i.e. direct targeets of
a same transcription factor).


<p>The selection of a random set of genes is a very simple but very
efficient way to check the rate of false positives of pattern
discovery programs.

</ul>
<a name=example></a><h2>Example of utilization</h2>
<ul>

We will use the tool <i><b>random-genes</b></i> to select a randdom selection of 20
genes in the yeast genome, and submit their promoters to
oligo-analysis. 

<p>
<ol>

<li>In the left frame, click on the link <b><i>random gene
selection</i></b>.

<li>Select as organism <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>

<li>Set the number of genes to 20. 

<li>Leave the number of groups to 1 (this option is used for
generating multiple random gene clusters).

<li>Select <b>CDS</b> as feature type.

<li>Click <b>GO</b>

</ol>

The result is a list of gene identifiers. 

<p>You can now send this list to the program
<i><b>retrieve-seq</b></i>, to retrieve their upstream sequences, and
then to different motif discovery programs
(<b><i>oligo-analysis</i></b>, <b><i>consensus</i></b>,
<b><i>gibbs</i></b>, ...) in order to test the response of these
programs when the genes are not supposed to be co-regulated.



</ul>
<a name=interpret></a><h2>Interpreting the results</h2>
<ul>

<p>In principle, we expect for the program to return, most of the
time, a negative answer, i.e. not a single significant motif. In some
cases, a motif witth slight significance should emerge by chance, and
highly significant motifs should appear very exceptionally. 

<p>More precisely, if we repeat the experiment a large number of
times, we expect to find more or less
<ul>
<li>one motif with E-value <= 1 (i.e. sig >= 1) per gene selection;
<li>a motif with E-value <= 0.1 (sig >= 1) every 10 gene selections;
<li>a motif with E-value <= 0.01 (sig >= 2) every 100 gene selections;
<li>... and so on.
</ul>

<p>The analysis of random gene selections is thus a very practical way
to estimate the rate of false positives of motif discovery programs,
on the basis of real biological sequences.

</ul>
<a name=exercises></a><h2>Additional exercises</h2>
<ol>

<li>In order to check the rate of false positive of a program, you
need to repeat the random control several times, and see how often a
motif is selected by chance when there is supposedly no co-regulation.

<p>

<ul>

<li>Repeat the test a few times. 

<li>At each trial, take note of the top scoring motif, and of the
score associated to it.

<li>Analyze the results of the successive trials, and check if the
behaviour more or less corresponds to the theoretical expectation.
</ul>

<p>
<li>Perform the same test as above, with human genes. How does it
compare with the yeast, in terms of false positives ?

<p>
<li>You can also use the upstream sequences of random gene selections
to test other motif discovery programs available on the web (see the
<a target=_blank href=../links.html#pattern_disco>link page</a>).
