\section{Description}

This documents contain the installation guide for the package
\textbf{Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT)}.

In the current release, the version is limited to the perl scripts,
and does not contain the web interface.


\section{Installation}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Uncompress the archive containing the programs. 
\begin{verbatim}
tar -xpzf rsat_yyyymmdd.tgz
\end{verbatim}

where yyyymmdd stands for the version number (delivery date).

\end{enumerate}

\section{Adding rsa-tools to your path}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Create an environment variable named RSAT and containing the
path of rsa-tools. For example, assuming rsa-tools have been installed
in the directory \texttt{/usr/local/rsa-tools}, and your shell is bash
:

\begin{verbatim}
export RSAT=/usr/local/rsa-tools
\end{verbatim}

\item add the path of rsa-tools/perl-scripts to your path.
\begin{verbatim}
export PATH=${PATH}:${RSAT}/perl-scripts
\end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Testing the installation}

From now on, you should be able to use the perl scripts from the
command line. To test this, run: 

\begin{verbatim}
random-seq -help
\end{verbatim}

This should display the on-line help for the random sequence
generator. 

\begin{verbatim}
random-seq -l 200 -r 4 -a a:t 0.3 c:g 0.2
\end{verbatim}

Should generate a random sequence.

We will now testif the genomes are correctly installed. You will
obtain the list of supported organisms with the command:

\begin{verbatim}
retrieve-seq -help
\end{verbatim}

Select an organism (say \organism{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}), and
retrieve all the start codons with the following options :

\begin{verbatim}
retrieve-seq -org Saccharomyces_cerevisiae \
        -type upstream -from 0 -to +2 -all \
        -format wc -nocomment 
\end{verbatim}

This should return a set of 3 bp sequences, mostly ATG (in the case of
\organism{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} at least)

\end{document}
