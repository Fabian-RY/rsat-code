If you are using a recent version of SOAP::WSDL (2.0 and above) for your perl
clients, you can not work with the currently provided clients. These clients are still
compatible with the older versions of SOAP::WSDL. Example clients for the new versions will be
available to download soon.

<td>
Programs with <b>lth</b> and <b>uth</b> parameters (e.g. oligo_analysis, matrix_scan...) now support multiple thresholds.
<p/><i>Example</i>: 'lth' in oligo_analysis can take values 'occ_sig 1' and 'occ 1'.
<p/>Use an array instead of a string for lth and uth in your
clients. Example clients to download have been updated accordingly.
