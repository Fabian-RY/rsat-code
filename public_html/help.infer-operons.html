<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<ul>
<p>Given a list of input genes, infer the operon to which each of these
genes belong.</p>
<p>The inference is based on a <strong>very</strong> simplistic distance-based method,
inspired from the Salgado & Moreno-Hagelsieb method (<a target=_blank href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=10823905">Proc Natl Acad Sci U S
A. 2000;97:6652-7</a>). The Salgado & Moreno-Hagelsieb method classifies intergenic
distances as <i><b>TUB</b></i> (transcription unit border) or <i><b>WO</b></i> (within operon),
and infers operons by iteratively collecting genes until a TUB is
found. In the original method, the TUB or WO assignation relies on a
log-likelihood score calculated from a training set.</p>

<p>The difference is that we do not use the <i><b>log-likelihood</b></i> (which
presents risks of over-fitting), but a <i>simple threshold on
the intergenic distance</i>. Thus, we infer that the region upstream of a gene is TUB if
its size is larger than a given distance threshold, and WO
otherwise. Our validations (Rekin&rsquos Janky and Jacques van Helden,
<i>unpublished results</i>) show that a simple threshold on distance raises a
similar accuracy as the log-likelihood score (Acc ~ 78% for a
threshold t=55).</p>
</ul>
<h1><a name="dist_thr">ALGORITHM (DISTANCE THRESHOLD)</a></h1>
<p>The algorithm is based on three simple rules, depending on the
relative orientation of the adjacent genes.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="item_rule_1_3a_divergently_transcribed_genes">Rule 1: divergently transcribed genes</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>If the gene found upstream of a query gene is transcribed in the
opposite direction, then the intergenic region is considered as a TUB,
and the two flanking genes are labelled as operon leaders. This
prediction is reliable (as far as genome annotation is correct), since
operons only contain genes on the same strand.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_rule_2_3a_convergently_transcribed_genes">Rule 2: convergently transcribed genes</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>If the gene found downstream of a query gene is transcribed in the
opposite direction, then the intergenic region is considered as a TUB,
and the two flanking genes are labelled as operon trailers. This
prediction is reliable (as far as genome annotation is correct), since
operons only contain genes on the same strand.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="item_genes">Rule 3: tandem genes (adjacent genes on the same strand)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>If two adjacent genes are on the same strand, then a distance
threshold (option -dist) is applied to decide whether they belong to
the same operon (dist &lt;= threshold) or not (dist &gt; threshold). If they
are predicted to be in distinct operon, the upstream gene is labelled
as operon trailer, and the downstream gene as leader of the next
operon.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<h1><a name="Genes">Genes</a></h1>
<p>Each row of the input specifies one query gene (similarly to <a href ="http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/help.retrieve-seq.html#genes">rerieve-seq</a>). The first word of a gene is the query, the rest of the row is ignored.</p>
