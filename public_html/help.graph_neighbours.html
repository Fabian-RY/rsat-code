</h2>
</center>

<h4>Description</h4>
<ul>

    Extract from a graph the neighbourhood of all or of a set of seed nodes.


</ul>


<h4>Options</h4><ul>
<A NAME="formats"></A>
<h4>Input formats</h4>
  The accepted input formats are GML, tab-delimited and adjacency matrix. 
  For more explanations about these, refer to the <a href = 'help.convert_graph.html'>manual of convert-graph</a>.
<h4>Output formats</h4>
  Two types of output formats are available.
  Without any specification, the program will return a four column
  file "neighbour", "seed", "number of steps" and "direction". This output can then be compared to other file using <a href = 'graph_get_clusters_form.php'>graph-get-clusters</a> or <a href = 'compare-classes_form.cgi'>compare-classes</a><br><br>
  The program can return one line for each seed node and display some information about the seed nodes neighbours. This option only works with weighted graphs. 
</ul>
<h4><A NAME="columns"></A>Column specifications (only for tab-delimited format)</h4>
<ul><A NAME="scol"></A><b>Source and target column</b>. Columns containing the source and target nodes. </ul>
<ul><A NAME="wcol"></A><b>Weight or label column</b> Column containing the weight or the label on the edge. </ul>

</ul>
<h4>Nodes<ul><A NAME="seeds"></A></h4>
The seed nodes for which the degree is seeked
</ul>

</ul>
<h4>Seed nodes inclusion<ul><A NAME="self"></A></h4>
Include each node in its neighborhood, with a distance of 0,
even if there is no self-loop at this node. This allows to
extract the node together with its neighborhood, rather than the
neighborhood only (default). This option cannot be used with the
one line per seed node format.</ul>
