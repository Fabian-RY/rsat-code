<h4><a name="description">Description</a></h4>

<ul>
    Given a number of source and a number of target nodes, enumerate the k lightest paths connecting any of the
    source nodes with any of the target nodes in the order of their weight.
    Paths are simple, that is no node can occur more than once in the path.
    <br>
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="credits"></A>Credits</h4>
<ul>
   Pathfinder is a Java wrapper around REA written by Jimenez and Marzal in C [1]. It has been
   inspired by a Python wrapper written by Pierre Schaus and Jean-No&euml;l Monette at <a href='http://www.uclouvain.be/ingi.html' target='_blank'>UCL (INGI)</a>.
   See the <a href="https://gforge.info.ucl.ac.be/projects/bioedge/" target='_blank'>Cytoscape plugins</a> by Pierre Schaus and Jean-No&euml;l Monette for their k shortest paths tool.
   Note that Pierre Schaus and Jean-No&euml;l Monette also modified the REA code.
   The multiple-to-multiple end path finding relies on a graph transformation suggested
   by Olivier Hubaut (former aMAZE team member) and also described in [2]. Pathfinder makes use of a graph library
   developed by the former <a href="http://www.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/amaze/" target='_blank'> aMAZE team</a>.
</ul>

<h4><A NAME="graph"></A>Input graph</h4>
	<ul>
	<b>graph</b><br>
		The input graph can be either in tab-delimited or gml format.
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<b>graph file</b><br>
		A file containing a graph in either tab-delimited or gml format.
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<b>graph id</b><br>
		The identifier of a graph that has been submitted and stored on
		the server. This allows to avoid re-submitting large graphs.
		The identifier is assigned by Pathfinder. For storage of graphs
		on the server side, see <A HREF='help.pathfinder.html#server'>below</a>.
		<font color = "red">Warning: The weight of already submitted graphs cannot be changed!</font><br>
	</ul>
	<ul><A NAME="directed"></A><b>Directed</b><br>
	Check the "directed" option to signal that the input graph is directed.
	This option is important for tab-delimited format, because this format,
	in contrast to gml, does not specifiy whether a graph is directed or undirected.
	Results may greatly vary between path finding done on the same input graph treated as
	undirected or as directed!
	</ul>
	<ul><A NAME="server"></A><b>Storage of input graphs on server</b><br>
	To submit large input graphs can take time. In addition, Pathfinder generates
	temp files each time it is called. Re-using a graph and its associated
	temp files saves time. This is why input graphs can be stored on the server.
	Select this option and save the graph identifier that Pathfinder returns.
	The next time you want to work on the same graph, enter its
	identifier in the graph id field.
	Although the input graphs themselves are stored an infinite time when this option has been set,
	result files generated from them are only available during three days.
	</ul>

<h4><A NAME="terminals"></A>Input nodes</h4>

	<ul><b>Sources and targets</b><br>
	If several source and/or target node identifiers are given, they are separated by '/'.
	Example:<br>
	Source nodes: a/b/c<br>
	Target nodes: d
	</ul>
	<ul><A NAME="batchfile"></A><b>Batchfile</b>
		A batchfile allows to do several path finding tasks in a row. It is a collection
		of sources and targets, which are specified in a tab-delimited file. Source nodes
		are assigned to a group containing START in its name and target nodes are assigned to a group
		containing END. The START and END groups are assigned to experiment groups, whose names can be chosen
		freely. Thus, each experiment is defined by a start group and an end group, which in turn consist of
		start nodes and end nodes.
		Comments in the batchfile are preceded by #.
		<pre>
		# example for batchfile describing two path finding experiments
		# the first experiment has source R04511 and target C00191
		# the second experiment has source R04198 and targets C00080 and C00681
		R04511	START1
		C00191	END1
		R04198	START2
		C00080	END2
		C00681	END2
		START1	EXP1
		END1	EXP1
		START2	EXP2
		END2	EXP2
		</pre>
	</ul>

<h4><A NAME="formats"></A>Graph formats</h4>

	<ul>
	<b>Preface</b><br>
	The tab-delimited format is simpler and therefore faster to transfer than
	the gml format. <font color="red">Warning: For tab-delimited format, the user needs
	to specify whether or not the graph is directed.</font>
	See the option described <a href="help.pathfinder.html#directed">above</a> to do this.<br>
	<font color="red">Warning: The tab-delimited format with a node part is restricted to Pathfinder
	and cannot be read in by other NeAT tools.</font>
	</ul><ul>
	<b><A NAME="tab"></A>Tab-delimited</b><br>
	<ol>
	<li>The tab-delimited format in its most simple form is a list of arcs.
	Optionally, weights can be set as third column. Example:<br>
	<pre>
	; example tab-delimited graph as arc list with weights on arcs
	a	b	1.1
	b	c	2.4
	c	a	3
	</pre>
	</li>
	<li>If one wants to give nodes (i.e. to include orphan nodes or to set node attributes),
	the node identifiers can be set as one column, along with their weights. Arcs
	are separated from nodes by a line starting with ;ARCS. Example:<br>
	<pre>
	; example tab-delimited graph with nodes
	a
	b
	c
	d
	;ARCS
	a	b	1.1
	b	c	2.4
	c	a	3
	</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Additional node or arc attribute values along with the attribute name can be set
	by setting tab-delimited node or arc attribute headers. Example:<br>
	<pre>
	; example tab-delimited graph with nodes having values for a color attribute
	;NODES	color
	a	yellow
	b	blue
	c	blue
	d	yellow
	;ARCS
	a	b	1.1
	b	c	2.4
	c	a	3
	</pre>
	Attributes can also be set on the arcs. Example:
	<pre>
	; example tab-delimited graph with nodes having values for a color attribute
	; and arcs having values for a probability attribute
	;NODES	color
	a	yellow
	b	blue
	c	blue
	d	yellow
	;ARCS	probability
	a	b	0.9	1.1
	b	c	0.5	2.4
	c	a	0.1	3
	</pre>
	# is an alternative comment symbol. If not specified otherwise, the last node or
	arc column is always treated as weight column.
	</li>
	</ol>
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<b><A NAME="gml"></A>GML</b><br>
	The gml format is a generic format allowing to store data as a tree of objects
	consisting of attribute and value pairs. It is widely used for describing graphs.
	It allows to set attributes on nodes, arcs and the graph itself. See <a href="http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/gml-tr.html" target='_blank'>here</a>
	for more information on this format.
	</ul>

<h4><a name="options"></a>Options</h4>

	<ul><A NAME="rank"></A><b>Rank</b><br>
	This option specifies how many paths should be found. If for example rank is set to three,
	Pathfinder attempts to find three paths of increasing weight, unifying paths of equal weight into one.
	</ul>
	<ul><A NAME="weight"></A><b>Weight</b><br>
	Three options are available.<br>
	<ol>
	<li>unit: This option sets a weight of one on each node.</li>
	<li> degree: This option sets a weight equal to its degree on each node.</li>
	<li>as given in input graph: This option should be set to use weights given in the graph.
	<font color="red">Warning: Weights should be set on the arcs/edges as values of the attribute "Weight".</font><br>
	Example for edge in tab-delimited format:<br>
	1	2	3.22<br>
	or<br>
	;ARCS	Weight<br>
	1	2	3.22<br>
	Example for edge in gml format:<br>
	edge[ source 1 target 2 Weight 3.22]<br>
	</li>
	</ol><br>
	Node weights are transformed into edge/arc weights by taking the mean of
	the head and tail node weights. The k shortest paths algorithm (see <a href="help.pathfinder.html#credits">Credits</a>)
	expects arc weights as input.
	</ul>

<h4><A NAME="advanced">Advanced options</a></h4>
	<ul><A NAME="constraints"></A><b>Maximal Weight</b><br>
	This option sets the maximal weight a path can have. The weight of a path is the sum of its edges.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>Maximal Length</b><br>
	This option sets the maximal length a path can have. The length of a path is defined as its number of nodes.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>Minimal Length</b><br>
	This option sets the minimal length a path should have.
	</ul>
	<ul><b><A NAME="exclusion"></A>Exclusion attribute</b><br>
	This option allows to specify the name of the exclusion attribute.
	The exclusion attribute is set if certain nodes should not appear together in one path.
	Nodes sharing the same value for the exclusion attribute are treated as mutually exclusive.
	</ul>
	<ul><b><A NAME="metabolic"></A>Metabolic</b><br>
	A metabolic graph is defined as follows: It has values on its nodes for two attributes, namely "ObjectType"
	and the given exclusion attribute. The "ObjectType" attribute has two values: one for compound nodes ("Compound") and one for reaction nodes ("Reaction").
	In addition, the graph is directed.<br>
	This definition follows from our experience that metabolic graphs should be represented as directed, bipartite graphs, where
	forward and reverse direction of a reaction are mutually exclusive (see <a href='neat_publications.html'>publications</a>).<br>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Tab-delimited metabolic graphs</b><br>
	In a tab-delimited file, you should set the "ObjectType" column as second column after the node identifiers and the exclusion attribute column as third column.
	Don't set column headers and leave the "Exclusion attribute" option blank.</li>
	<li><b>GML metabolic graphs</b><br>
	In GML format, you should use the "ObjectType" attribute and an exclusion attribute, whose name should be
	specified with the "Exclusion attribute" option.</li>
	<li><b>Purpose of the attributes</b><br>
	The "ObjectType" attribute changes the behaviour of the "degree" weight policy: Nodes with "Reaction" as value of "ObjectType" receive
	a weight of one, whereas nodes with "Compound" as value receive a weight according to their degree.<br>
	The exclusion attribute causes forward and reverse direction of a reaction to be treated as mutually exclusive.<li>
	<li><b>Exclusion attribute values for REA algorithm</b><br>
	For REA, the exclusion attribute values should be given as follows:<br>
	<ol>
	<li>A compound should have the same string as identifier and exclusion attribute value.</li>
	<li>Reaction identifiers and exclusion attribute of reactions match except for the last character in the reaction identifier string<br>
      - direct reactions have an identifier composed of exclusion attribute and the direct reaction symbol (i.e. ">")<br>
      - reverse reactions have an identifier composed of exclusion attribute and the reverse reaction symbol (i.e. "<") <br></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><b>Example of a metabolic graph</b><br>
	Here is a small example for a metabolic graph in tab-delimited format:
	<pre>
	; small example for a metabolic graph
	R02283>	Reaction	R02283
	R02283<	Reaction	R02283
	C00437	Compound	C00437
	C00631	Compound	C00631
	R01518>	Reaction	R01518
	R01518<	Reaction	R01518
	;ARCS
	R02283<	C00437
	C00437	R02283>
	C00631	R01518>
	R01518<	C00631
	</pre>
	</li>
	<li><b><A NAME="rpairs"></A>Metabolic RPAIR graph</b><br>
	This is a special case of a metabolic graph that has been constructed from reactant pairs (sub-reactions) taken from KEGG RPAIR
	and from compounds listed in KEGG LIGAND. You can find paths in pre-loaded graphs by using the
	<a href="http://rsat.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/metabolicpathfinding/metabolicPathfinder_form.jsp">metabolic path finder</a>, which
	also allows you to submit custom metabolic RPAIR graphs.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<b><A NAME="algorithm"></A>Algorithm</b><br>
	You can choose between REA (the default, see <a href='help.pathfinder.html#literature'>[1]</a>) or backtracking
	developed by Fabian Couche and Didier Croes (see <a href='neat_publications.html'>publications</a>).
	<font color='red'>You can use backtracking only on metabolic graphs and only with a pre-defined weighting scheme.
	Backtracking treats the input graph as directed and sets weights as follows: compound nodes receive their degree
	as weight and reaction nodes receive a weight of one. Only one start and one end node can be given.</font>
	</ul>

<h4><A NAME="output"></A><b>Output</b></h4>
	<ul>
	<b>Preface</b><br>
	In general, result files are stored no longer than three days on the server,
	so make sure you download them on time, if you need them.<br>
	Pathfinder unifies all paths of equal weight into one pathway. Thus, a pathway
	does not need to be linear.
	<br>
	Because Pathfinder treats paths of equal weight as one pathway, the option "rank"
	is interpreted as the requested maximal weight level. Pathfinder attempts to find as many
	weight levels (with any number of paths belonging to a given weight level)
	as ranks have been specified.
	<br>
	Of course, if less than the requested number of paths
	is present in the graph, Pathfinder cannot return these paths.<br>
	If a graph is requested as Output type, the nodes have values for the
	"Path_Rank" attribute, to distinguish different paths in the graph.
	Nodes and edges/arcs belonging to a path are colored in gold (that is they
	have a value "gold" for attribute color and value "#FFD700" for attribute rgb_color).
	<br><br>
	The following output types are available:<br>
	<ol>
	<li>
	<b>table of paths</b><br>
	Pathfinder returns the requested number of lightest paths ranked according to their weight in a table.
	The table can be converted into a graph.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>input graph with paths highlighted</b><br>
	Pathfinder returns the input graph with paths highlighted in another color.<br>
	The modified input graph can be input of further analysis steps. Its format can be
	specified by setting output format either to "tab-delimited" or to "gml".
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>each path as a separated component of a single graph</b><br>
	Pathfinder returns the requested number of paths as separated
	components of one graph in the desired output format (gml or tab-delimited). The graph can be
	input of further analsysis steps.
	Note that each component merges all paths of equal weight.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>paths unified into one graph</b><br>
	Pathfinder returns the paths unified into one graph, which is returned in the desired
	output format ("gml" or "tab-delimited"). The graph can be input of further analsysis steps.</li>
	</ol>
	</ul>

<h4><A NAME="email"></A><b>Email</b></h4>
	<ul>You can optionally specify an email address, so Pathfinder results can be sent to you by email.
		This is recommended for very large graphs or batch files, which might require a computation
		time above the server timeout.
		If you leave the email field empty, results will be displayed in the browser.
	</ul>

<h4><A NAME="next">Next steps panel</a></h4>
	<ul>The next steps panel allows you to input the result of Pathfinder into one of the listed tools without copy-pasting
	the result into that tool. The next steps panel will only appear if you request a graph output.
	</ul>

<h4><A NAME="limit">Limitations</a></h4>
	<ul>Format limitations:
	<ol>
	<li>Pathfinder cannot deal with multi-edges (several edges between two nodes) or hyper-edges (edges between more than two nodes).</li>
	<li>Pathfinder does not process correctly mixed graphs (mixtures of undirected and directed graphs).</li>
	</ol>Algorithmic limitations:
	<ol>
	<li>REA does not allow a graph with negative-length cycles reachable from the start nodes. Therefore, negative weights on arcs should be used carefully, if at all.</li>
	</ol>Runtime:
	<ol>
	<li>Runtime depends strongly on the size of the graph and the number of paths asked. A timeout of 10 minutes has been set.<br>
	We tested REA on metabolic graphs up to 44,000 arcs. With degree weighting scheme and paths requested up to second rank, the algorithm usually completed within one minute.
	Be aware that for unit weighting scheme, runtime can be much longer, because many more paths of equal weight may exist.
	In this case, the runtime may exceed the server timeout.
	Whenever a timeout occurs, you might try to repeat the search with your email address set. This will circumvent the server timeout.
	</li>
	</ol>
	</ul>

<h4><A NAME="webservice">Web service</a></h4>
	<ul>In contrast to other tools in RSAT/NeAT, Pathfinder has been implemented in Java for historical reasons
	and runs as axis web service. Therefore, clients have to call the wsdl file located at<br>
	<a href='http://rsat.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/be.ac.ulb.bigre.graphtools.server/wsdl/GraphAlgorithmsNeAT.wsdl' target='_blank'>http://rsat.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/be.ac.ulb.bigre.graphtools.server/wsdl/GraphAlgorithmsNeAT.wsdl</a> and not the one of RSAT/NeAT.
	This wsdl file has the same format as the one of RSAT and clients can be written
	the same way as for RSAT. The only change required is for the address of the wsdl file.
	WSDL documentation is available <a href='http://rsat.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/be.ac.ulb.bigre.graphtools.server/wsdl/GraphAlgorithms_documentation.xml'>here</a>.
	An example client in Java can be downloaded from <a href='http://www.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/Users/karoline/graphtoolsdemo.zip'>here</a>.
	</ul>

<h4><A NAME="standalone">Standalone tool</a></h4>
	<ul>A stand alone version of Pathfinder is available <a href="http://www.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/Users/karoline/Graphtools.zip">here</a>.
