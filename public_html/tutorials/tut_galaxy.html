      <hr><a name='prerequisite'></a><h2>Prerequisite</h2>

    <p>This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the concepts
      related to High-Throughput sequencing (reads, read mapping) and
      ChIP-seq technology (peaks).</p>

    
    <hr><a name='intro'></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This tutorial does not direclty use RSAT tools, but explains how to
      obtain datasets that can be used as input for the RSAT
      program <a href='../peak-motifs_form.cgi' target='_parent'><i>peak-motifs</i></a>.</p>

    <p>The Galaxy server (<a target='_blank'
			     href='http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/'>http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/</a>)
      combines a wide variety of programs for accessing and analyzing
      genomic sequences. Those tools are remarkably powerful and
      efficient, and they are accompanied with an excellent documentation,
      including training videos.</p>

    <p>The goal of this tutorial is to give a short explanation of the
      successions of operations that permit retrieving peak sequences
      from the Galaxy server, starting from a set of reads or peaks
      annotated in the Gene Expression Omnibus database
      (GEO <a target='_blank'
      href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/'>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</a>). </p>

    <hr><a name='coord'></a><h2>Obtaining ChIP-seq read and peak coordinates in the GEO database</h2>
 
    <p><b>Goal:</b> Identify the dataset corresponding to the article
      by Chen et al., 2008 (Pubmed ID: <a target='_blank'
      href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=18555785[uid]'>18555785</a>)
      in the <a target='_blank'
      href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/'>GEO datasets</a> and
      Retrieve the data for the <b>Sox2</b> experiment.</p>

    <div class='protocol'>
      <h3>Protocol</h3>
      <ol>

	<li><p>Open a connection to the <a target='_blank'
					   href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/'>Pubmed</a>
	    database.</p></li>
  
	<li>
	  <p>In the text box, enter the title of the article:
      
	    <ul><i>Integration of external signaling pathways with the
		core transcriptional network in embryonic stem
		cells</i></ul>
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>This should give a single result. If this is not the case, you
	    can select the publication on the basis of its PubMed
	    ID <a target='_blank'
		  href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=18555785[uid]'>18555785</a></p>
	</li>
  
	<li><p>On the right side of the Pubmed record, under the
	    title <b>All links from this record</b>, click the
	    link <b>GEO DataSets</b>. This opens the
	    record <a target='_blank'
	    href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE11431'>GSE11431</a>
	    with the title <i>Mapping of transcription factor binding
	    sites in mouse embryonic stem cells</i>.
      
	    <ul><p>Note: the title of the record differs from the
	      title of the article, which makes it somewhat difficult
	      to identify a record by browsing the GEO datasets
	      alone. The easiest way to go from an article to the
	      corresponding records is generally to use the direct
	      link from PubMed to GEO DataSets, as we did.</p></ul>
	</p></li>
      
	<li><p>In the GEO database, the identifiers with
	    prefix <i>GSE</i> denote <i>series</i> of
	    experiments. Chen et al. (2008) published ChIP-seq results
	    for various transcription factors, so that the series
	    associated to this article contains 16 samples in
	    total.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>The bottom of the GSE record provides the list
	    of <i>samples</i> (identifiers starting
	    with <i>GSM</i>). Click on the link corresponding an
	    experiment of your choice (e.g. <b>ES_Oct4</b>, sample
	    ID <a target='_blank'
	    href='http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM288346'>GSM288346</a>).
	</p></li>
	
	<li><p> Read the information available about this sample. The bottom
	    of the record provides links to the data sets at various
	    processing stages:
	  <p><ul>
	      <li>The <b><i>SRA</i></b> files contain the raw sequences of
		the reads produced by the massively parallel
		sequencer. For the Oct4 sample, there are 4 files each
		containing more than 5 million reads (~150 Megabases of
		sequence per file). These files are quite heavy, and we
		don't need to download them for the purpose of this
		tutorial.
	  </ul></p>
	</p></li>
	      
	<p><li>The <b><i>txt</i></b> file <a target='_blank'
	      href='ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM288nnn/GSM288346/GSM288346%5FES%5FOct4%2Etxt%2Egz'>
	      SM288346_ES_Oct4.txt.gz</a> contains a set of peaks
	      selected by Chen et al. (2008). These peaks are provided
	      in a tab-delimited text file, the first column indicates
	      the chromosome, the second column the start and the
	      third column the end of each peak. This bed file can be
	      uploaded to Galaxy in order to directly retrieve the
	      sequences of the peaks published by Chen and colleagues
	      in their original paper. However, in this tutorial we
	      will perform one additional step: we will run a peak
	      calling program (MACS) in order to identify the regions
	      enriched in reads (the peaks). For this, we need to
	      access another type of data: the coordinates of the
	      reads.
	</li></p>

	<p><li>The <b><i>bed</i></b> file <a target='_blank'
	      href='ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM288nnn/GSM288346/GSM288346%5FOct4%2Ebed%2Egz'>
	      GSM288346_Oct4.bed.gz</a> contains the location of the
	      reads. This is the file we will use as input to identify
	      the significant peaks (see section 
	    <i><a href='#peak_calling'>Peak calling</a></i>

    <h2>Opening a custom session in Galaxy</h2>
    
    <p>The Galaxy Web server offers a wide variety of tools for analyzing
      genomic data. </p>
    
    
    <p>To take benefit of all the advantages of Galaxy, you can open an
      account on the server, which will allow you to keep a trace of
      previous analyses and store the data and results on their
      server. </p>

    <div class='protocol'>
      <ol>
	<li><p>Open a connection to the Galaxy server (<a target='_blank'
							  href='http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/'>http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/</a>).</p></li>
	
	<li><p>On the top of the window, open the command <b>User >
	      Login</b> and provide your email address and password (at
	    the first connection, you must fill a form to obtain a
	    login). </p></li>
	
      </ol>
    </div>
    
    <hr><a name='galaxy_upload'></a>
    <h2>Uploading mapped reads to Galaxy</h2>
    
    <div class='protocol'>
      <ol>
      
	<li><p>In the menu at the left of the window, click <b>Get
	      Data > Upload File</b>.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>You can either upload a file from your computer
	    (click <b>Browse</b> besides the <b>File</b> text box) or from a
	    Web server (type a link to the file in the <b>URL/Text</b> box).
	    <ul>For this exercise, we will upload the read location file
	      from GEO (<tt>.bed</tt> file described above). In
	      the <b>URL/Text</b> box, paste the URL of the Oct4 sample:
	      <pre>ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/geo/DATA/supplementary/samples/GSM288nnn/GSM288346/GSM288346%5FOct4%2Ebed%2Egz</pre>
	    </ul>
	</p></li>
  
	<li><p>In the <b>Genome</b> pop-up menu, select <i>Mouse Feb
	      2006 (NCBI36/mm8)</i>. Tip: he genome is selected if you
	    simply type <i>mm8</i> when the menu is selected.</p></li>
  
	<li><p>Leave the other options to their default value, and
	    click <b>Execute</b>. The upload may take several
	    minutes. 
	    <ul>
	      <li><b>Note:</b> the upload speed depends on the
		availability of the two servers. Indeed, the coordinates of
		the ChIP-seq reads were directly transferred from GEO to
		Galaxy, without transiting by your computer. .</li>
	    </ul>
	</p></li>

	<li><p>When the file will be uploaded, the yellow box on the
	    right side will turn to green. Click on this box and check
	    that the format is BED and the genome ("database") is
	    mm8. </p></li>

	<li>Always check the content of a dataset before using it. For
	  this, Galaxy provides a very convenient interface: click on
	  the eye icon in the green box. The page should look like this: 
	  <pre>

	<li><p>We recommend to rename the Galaxy entry for the sake of
	    readability.
	    <ul>
	      <li>In the green box representing your uploaded data,
		click on the pencil (<i><b>Edit attributes</i></b>).
	      <li>The field <b><i>Name</i></b> currently contains the

	<li>By clicking on the title of the green box ("1: Chen 2008
	  ES_Oct4 reads"), you obtain some quantitative information
	  about the dataset. Check that the downloaded read contains
	  the expected number of reads. Its should display the
	  following information.
	  <pre>
 ~4,700,000 regions

      <h3>Exercise</h3>

      <p>Run the same protocol to download the sample GSM288358 from
	GEO. This sample was obtained by immunoprecipitating green
	fluorescent protein (GFP). In principle, it should thus not
	contain any specific peak. It can optionally be used as
	control ("mock") for peak-calling programs. After download,
	rename the dataset "Chen 2008 ES_GFP reads".</p>
    </div>

    <hr><a name='peak_calling'></a><h2>Peak calling with MACS</h2>

    <div class='protocol'>
      <ol>
	<li><p>In the left frame of the Galaxy window, you can see a set of
	    specialized tools for analyzing data from Next Generation
	    (<b>NGS TOOLBOX BETA</b>).</p></li>
	
	<li><p>Click <b>NGS:Peak Calling > MACS Model-based Analysis of
	      ChIP-Seq</b>.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>Enter an <b>Experiment Name</b> (e.g. <i>OCT4 Chen-2008
	peaks MACS no input</i>).</p></li>
	
	<li><p>For the <b>ChIP-seq tag file</b>, select the file you
	    uploaded in the previous step (if you performed all the steps
	    above, it should appear as "<i>Chen 2008 ES_Oct4 reads</i>" in the pop-up
	    menu). </p></li>

	<ul>
	  <li><p><b>Note:</b> in a first time, we will run the
	      peak-calling without providing any control. In case you
	      would dispose of a control set, you could enter its
	      mapped read BED file as
	      <b>Control tag file</b> This wil be done as an exercise
	      below.</p></li>
	</uL>
	
	<li><p><b>Effective genome size</b>: this is the size of the genome
	    considered "usable" for peak calling. This value is given by the
	    MACS developpers on their website. It is smaller than the
	    complete genome because many regions are excluded (telomeres,
	    highly repeated regions...). The default value is for human
	    (2700000000.0), as we work on mouse,
	    choose <i>1870000000.0</i> </p></li>
	
	<li><p>Set the <b>Tag size</b> to 26bp (the default is 25).
	</p></li>
	
	<!--  <li><p>Set the values of the parameter <i><b>3 levels of regions

	      <ul>
		<li><b>Note:</b> the default values are much larger for this
		  parameter, in order to support the detection of wide enriched
		  regions, such as those detected in the analysis of chromatin
		  accessibility or histone modifications.  For ChIP-seq
		  experiments involving a pull-down of specific transcription
		  factors, region sizs shoudl typicaly correspond to the
		  expected sizes of cis-regulatory modules (a few hundreds
		  bp).</li>
	      </uL>
	      </p></li>
	  -->

	<li>Optionally, you can activate the option <i>Save shifted
	    raw tag count at every bp into a wiggle file</i> (by
	    default, it displays (<i>Do not create a wig file
	    (faster)</i>). It is useful to activate this option
	    (select <i>Save</i>) in order to obtain a wig file, which
	    indicates the density of reads at regular intervals along
	    the chromosomes. Wig files are convenient for visual
	    inspection of the peak-calling results (e.g. visualizing
	    the density of reads under the peaks).</li>
	
	<li><p>Leave all other options to their default values and
	    click <b>Execute</b>.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>While the program is running, two yellow boxes should
	    appear in the "History" frame at the right of the Galaxy
	    Window. After completion of the job, the boxes will be
	    colored in green. The first box contains an HTML page with
	    links to the results in various formats. The second box
	    contain a BED file with the coordinates of the peaks. How
	    many peaks ("regions") were detected by MACS ?</p></li>
	

	<li><p>Once the result is available, click on the pencil to
	    change the information. Rename the dataset (e.g. <i>Oct4
	      peaks from MACS</i>).</p></li>

	<li><p>Optionally, you can upload the peak coordinates to the
	    UCSC genome browser to visualize them on the mouse
	    chromosomes. For this, you can simply click on the
	    link <b>display at UCSC main</b> in the green box <i>Oct4

      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="exo">

      <h3>Exercises</h3>


      <p>In the protocol above, we used the simplest approach to
	detect peaks with MACS: we entered a single file (the "test"
	reads) and adapted some parameters to the particularity of our
	experiment (e.g. genome size, tag size).</p>
      <p>Some peak-calling programs (including MACS) allow users to
	submit a second set of reads as control. Typical controls are
	"mock" datasets, i.e. genomic sequences obtained from a
	non-immunoprecipitated protein, or genomic DNA. In Chen's
	experiment, the control consisted in performing the ChIP-seq
	with the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) instead of a
	transcripiton factor.</p>
      
      <ol>
	<li>Compute peaks with MACS, using the Oct4 reads as test
	  dayaset, and the GFP experiment as control. Compare the
	  number of peaks with the result of Oct4 when no control set
	  was provided. </li>
	<li>Run the MACS peak-calling procedure using GFP as test
	  dataset, and no dataset as control. Count the number of
	  peaks. Does it correspond to your expectation ?</li>
      </ol>
    </div>


    <hr><a name='seq'></a><h2>Retrieving peak sequences with Galaxy</h2>

    <p>The Galaxy Web server allows to quickly retrieve sequences from a
      coordinate file (eg. BED file). The coordinates can be provided in various forms: 
      <ul>
	<li> stored on the Galaxy server (e.g. MACS result of the previous
	  section),</li>
	<li>uploaded from a file on your computer,</li>
	<li>uploaded from an URL (e.g. from a GEO sample record).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <h3>Option A: retrieving sequences from the peak identified by MACS</h3>
    
    <div class='protocol'>
	  <ol>
	    <li><p>The BED file retrieved in the previous section
