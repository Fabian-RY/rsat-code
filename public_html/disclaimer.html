       Project Overview
EcoCyc is a collaborative project between Peter D. Karp of Pangea Systems Inc. and Monica Riley of the Marine Biological Laboratory.   Pangea Systems, Inc. is the the exclusive worldwide distributor of this product. The project is compiling a large knowledge base (KB) describing the genes and intermediary
metabolism of the bacterium E. coli. Genomic data is of more value when combined with information on gene function, such as descriptions of metabolic pathways. The EcoCyc KB describes each pathway and
 bioreaction of E. coli metabolism, and the enzyme that carries out each bioreaction, including its cofactors,  activators, inhibitors, and the subunit structure of the enzyme. When known, the genes encoding the subunits of an enzyme will be listed, as well as the map position of a gene on the E. coli chromosome. In addition, the KB describes the chemical compounds involved in each bioreaction, listing synonyms for the compound name, the molecular weight of the compound, and in many cases its chemical structure. 

        A graphical user interface allows biologists to query the KB, and to navigate through the genomic and
       metabolic information space for E. coli. We have developed a number of powerful and familiar visualizations of genomic and metabolic data, such as automatically generated layouts of metabolic pathways. 

        EcoCyc interoperates with other biological databases containing protein and nucleic-acid sequence data, bibliographic data, protein structures, and descriptions of different E. coli strains. In addition, the GenoPath computer software that underlies EcoCyc is not specific to E. coli, but has been applied to manage genomic and biochemical data for a variety of organisms. The demands of the EcoCyc project are driving a computer-science project that is developing a new generation of information management software for supporting the collaborative development of large biological knowledge bases. 

       The EcoCyc KB has a number of uses. It is an electronic reference source for E. coli biologists, and for biologists who work with related microorganisms. Scientists can visualize the layout of genes within the E. coli chromosome, or of an individual biochemical reaction, or of a complete biochemical pathway (with compound structures displayed). The navigation capabilities allow the user to move from a display of an enzyme to a display of a reaction that the enzyme catalyzes, or of the gene that encodes the enzyme. The
       interface also supports a variety of queries, such as generating a display of the map positions of all genes that code for enzymes within a given biochemical pathway. 

       As well as being used as a reference source to look up individual facts, the EcoCyc KB allows complex computations related to the metabolism, such as design of novel biochemical pathways for biotechnology,  studies of the evolution of metabolic pathways, and simulation of metabolic pathways. The Ecocyc KB is also  used for computer-based education in biochemistry.

       Pangea Systems is the exclusive world-wide distributor of EcoCyc.

       Current KB Size

       As of January 1998, the number of objects in the latest version of EcoCyc is: 
              4909 E. coli genes 
              804 enzymes encoded by these genes 
              988 metabolic reactions occurring in E. coli 
              123 metabolic pathways occurring in E. coli 
              1303 chemical compounds involved in E. coli metabolism 
              79 tRNAs 
              60 2-component signal transduction proteins 
              1697 citations to the primary literature 
       The polypeptides comprise both multimeric and monomeric proteins. The list of genes includes most known
       E. coli genes, not simply the genes that code for the listed polypeptides.

About the EcoCyc WWW Server

The EcoCyc WWW Server allows users to access the Encyclopedia of E. coli Genes and Metabolism (EcoCyc). EcoCyc is a database and graphical interface that allows the user to navigate through the information space of metabolic pathways and genomic data for the bacterium E. coli.  The user can perform several different types of queries: 

       Query a metabolic pathway from a menu of available pathways 
       Browse a diagram of the full E. coli metabolic map 
       Query any type of object by means of a substring search. You first use a menu to select the type of object to be
       queried (such as a gene), and then enter a substring (in this case a gene name substring) 
       Query a reaction by EC number 
       Browse classification hierarchies for pathways, compounds, genes, or EC numbers 

Once an object is displayed, the user can navigate to related objects by clicking on the name of an object, or on some other mouse-sensitive part of the screen. The mouse sensitive parts of the screen include the obvious items that are highlighted in the normal fashion by your WWW browser, plus certain regions within graphical drawings. For example, in pathway drawings, the compound and enzyme names are sensitive, as are the reaction arrows. In genomic map drawings, the gene names are sensitive, as are the tick marks along the DNA strand (clicking on a tick mark zooms in on a region of the map). The EcoCyc WWW Server at Pangea Systems Inc. dynamically generates a WWW page describing the selected object. 

A variety of additional information is available through the EcoCyc Home Page, including a User's Guide (html, compressed postscript, uncompressed postscript), a guide to the EcoCyc schema (html, compressed postscript, uncompressed postscript), and a number of publications. Instructions on how to create links from your site to EcoCyc objects are also available. 

To access the EcoCyc WWW Server that runs at Pangea Systems you must have an EcoCyc
account; click here for information on obtaining accounts.
