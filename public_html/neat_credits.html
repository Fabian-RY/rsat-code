<h2><a href=NeAT_home.html>Network Analysis Tools (NeAT)</A> - Credits</h2>
</center>

<p>The Network Analysis Tools integrate a set of programs implemented
at the <a target=_blank href=http://www.bigre.ulb.ac.be>Laboratoire de
Bioinformatique des G&eacute;nomes et des R&eacute;seaux (BiGRe)</a>,
plus a few programs developed by third parties (with the authorization
of their authors).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The programs for handling graphs and clusters (conversion,
comparisons, display) were mainly developed by Sylvain Broh&eacute;e and
Jacques van Helden. </p></li>

<li><p>The backtrack algorithm for metabolic path finding was
principally developed by Fabian Couche and Didier Croes and is available <a
href="http://www.scmbb.ulb.ac.be/Users/didier/pathfinding/" target='_blank'>here</a>. The path finding
web service implemented by Karoline Faust for NeAT relies on  REA (Jimenez & Marzal,
1999) and can be applied to any network. Both path finding tools were developed under the supervision of Jacques van Helden.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The respective contributions are indicated in more detail in the
manual pages of each tool.</p>

<ul>
<li>display-graph uses the <a href ='http://search.cpan.org/~mcnewton/PostScript-Simple-0.07/' target = '_blank'>PostScript-Simple</a> an <a href ='http://search.cpan.org/dist/GD/' target = '_blank'>GD</a> perl libraries.</li>
<li>convert-graph and display-graph uses the Fruchterman and Reingold layout algorithm available in the <a href = 'http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/index.html'>boost graph library</a>.</li>
<li>Pathfinder calls REA (Jimenez & Marzal, 1999) as k shortest paths
algorithm.</li>
