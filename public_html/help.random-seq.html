<H3>Description</H3>

<UL>
Generate random DNA sequences according to various probabilistic
models (Markov models or independently distributed nucleotides)
</UL>

<H3>Options</H3>

<UL>

<A NAME="length"></A>
<h4>Sequence length</h4>
<ul>
The length of each sequence.
</ul>

<A NAME="repet"></A>
<h4>Number of sequences</h4>
<ul>
Number of sequences. Most sequence format support multi-sequence files. 
</ul>

<A NAME="lw"></A>
<h4>Line width</h4>
<ul>
Line width. To obtain a single line per sequence, fill this option with 0. 
</ul>

<A NAME="lw"></A>
<h4>Sequence format</h4>
<ul>
Various sequence formats can be chosen through a pop-up menu. 
</ul>

<A NAME="proba"></A>
<h4>Nucleotide frequencies</h4>
<ul>

Random sequences can be generated according to different probabilistic models. 

<ul>

<li><b>Equiprobable nucleotides</B><br> This is the simplest model :
all nucleotides have the same prior probability.

<li><b>Independent nucleotides with distinct probabilities</b><br> A
specific prior probability can be attached to nucleotides (AT and CG
are grouped). This probability is constant over the sequence, i.e. each
nucleotide is generated independently of the preceding and succeeding
nucleotides.

<Li><b>Markov chains (calibrated on upstream non-coding
frequencies)</b><br> The random sequence has the same oligonucleotide
composition as observed in the non-coding regions located upstream of
all genes of the selected organism.  This is obtained by a Markov
chain process, where nucleotide probabilities vary at each position,
depending on the preceding nucleotides.

<ul>

<li><b>Organism</b> The reference organism (oligonucleotide
frequencies are pre-calculated for each supported organism, on the
basis of the complete set of upstream sequences).

<li><b>Oligonucleotide size</b> This determines which expected
oligonucleotide calibraiton table has to be used. The markov chain
order is this value minus one. For example, 

<ul>
<li>Calibrating with hexanucleoides (oligonucleotide length = 6) means
that the nucleotide at each position depends on the 5 preceding
nucleotides. This is this thus a Markov chain of order 5.

<li>Calibrating on single nucleotides (oligo length = 1) means that
each nucleotide is chosen independently off the preceding one. This is
thus a Bernouille model (or Markov chain of order 0).

</ul>
