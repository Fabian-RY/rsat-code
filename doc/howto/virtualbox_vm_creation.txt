Installing Ubuntu under Virtualbox
================================================================


================================================================
Creation of the virtual machine (with VirtualBox)
================================================================

Name and operating system
	Name: 
	      rsat-vb-ub14d for the "desktop" version of Ubuntu
	      rsat-vb-ub14s for the "server" version of Ubuntu
	Type: Linux
	Version: Ubuntu (64 bits)

Memory size:	2048 Mb

Hard drive:	Create a virtual hard drive now
Hard drive file type: VMDK (Virtual Machine Disk)
     	   I chose this option because it ensures a wider
	   compatibility with other OS and Virtual Machine 
	   management systems

	   Another (important) advantage of VMDK is that it enables to
	   split virtualdisks in files <=2Gb, which is convenient to
	   store them on FAT partitions.

Storage on physical hard drive: 
	Dynamically allocated

File location and size: 
     name of virtual hard drive file:    rsat-vb-ub14c
     max size of virtual hard drive:	 18GB

	    Beware: the size has be larger than you real needs,
	    because Ubuntu will automatically create some big
	    partitions (/dev and /run/shm). Since I allow dyanmical
	    memory allocation, I set the max size to 18Gb, which will
	    be grossly assigned as
	       14Gb for /
	       2Gb for /dev
	       2Gb for /run/user

   v Split into files less than 2Gb
	  -> this option allows to store the VM on FAT partitions for
             Windows host machines

================================================================
Network configuration
================================================================

VirtualBox offers many alternative ways to configure network
communications between the virtual machine, the host machine, and the
external network (see manual page
https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html).

We present here one possible way to configure your Virtual machine,
but this should be adapted to your particular security / flexibility
requirements, and the configuration of your local network.

We want for the RSAT server to be usable from the host system
(e.g. run the RSAT Web server from the Firefox application on my Mac
OSX system.

Celine found an excellent guide for setting the newtork:
  http://christophermaier.name/blog/2010/09/01/host-only-networking-with-virtualbox

Step 1: Enable host-only networks in VirtualBox preferences
     VirtualBox -> Preference 
     	->Select the "Network" tab
     	    -> Host-only Networks
	    Click "+" to create a new host-only network (should appear as vboxnet0)

Step2:  in the VirtualBox window, right-click on the Ubuntu14.04 machine, and select "Settings"
	-> Network -> Adater 1
	   -> select "Attached to Host-only Adapter" 

Enable fixed address in VirtualBox

In VirtualBox Preferences
 - open the tab "Network" > "Host-only Networks"
 - click on the "+" icon
 - this creates a network vboxnet0, and set the following options:
      IPv4 Address: 192.168.56.1
      IPv4 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0
      IPv6 Adress: blank
      IPv6 Network Mask Lengt: 0

After having created the VM, open its network settings.
We will activate several adapters:
   - at

- click on the tab "Adapter 1",
      - check "Enable Network Adapter"
      - Attached to: "Host-only Adapter"
      - Name: "vboxnet0" (this network must have been created
      - beforehand)

      This ensures that the VM can be reached from the host machine
      via the fixed IP address (e.g. 192.168.56.114) that will be
      specified manually after having installed the operating system
      (see below).

OPTIONAL
--------

- click on the tab "Adapter 2",
      - check "Enable Network Adapter"
      - Attached to : "Bridged Adapter"
      - Name: choose an option  (e.g. en0: Wi-Fi (Airport) according
              your local network environment (wi-fi or ethernet cable)

	BEWARE ! If you activate his adaptor your VM will be visible
	from external computers in the same network as the host
	machine.

================================================================
Mounting of the virtual disk rsat_data
================================================================

I created a separate virtual disk named rsat_data (Dynamical
allocation, 40.35Gb) to store the genomes.

I STILL HAVE TO SEE HOW TO MOUNT THIS VIRTUAL DISK.

================================================================
Ubuntu operating system installation
================================================================

Desktop version
---------------

The desktop version of Ubuntu presents the advantage of letting users
work directly in the graphical environment of the Ubuntu virtual
machine, which is convenient to open non-text result files for
visualization (web pages, images) and to analyze the results in other
graphical packages (R, openOffice, CytoScape, ...).

Ubuntu install disk downloaded from
  http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64+mac.iso

Started the default installation. Steps:
	- click the button: install Ubuntu

	- I checked "Download updates while installing", but this was
          probably not a good idea, since it took a while to download
          many packages that I don't actually need (e.g. "Language
          packs")

	- (leave the default) Erase disk and install Ubuntu, click "Install Ubuntu"

Who are you ?
    Your name			RSAT admin
    Your computer's name	rsat-vb-ub14d
    Pick a username 		rsat

# I should think about the possibility to activate "Log in
# automatically", in order to facilitate the distribution without
# providing a password to the users.

Server version
--------------

The server version is less comfortable than the desktop version, but
it should be more economic in terms of hard drive (and CPU/RAM for
graphical resources ?).

Language  English

Home page: choose "Install Ubuntu Server"

Language (again): English

Country, territory or area: other > Europe > France

Country to base the default locale setting: United Kingdom 
	(there is apparently no setting for France !)

Detect keyboard layout: No > French > French - French (Macintosh)

Your system has multiple network interfaces (I guess this corresponds
tothe 3 adapters specified in VirtualBox preferences).
      Primary network interface: eth0

host name: rsat-vb-ub14s

Full name of new user:	RSAT admin

Username for your account: rsat

Password for new user: the classical (only for RSAT team members)

Encrypt home directory ? No

Time: Europe/Paris

Partitioning method: (default) Guided - use entire disk and set up LVM

     Next partitioning options: I say "continue" to all with default values

 ... Installing the sysem ... (takes some time)

Configure the package manager
	  Leave the HTTP proxy blank
  -> ... configuring apt (takes some time)

Configuration taskse1
   Install security updates automatically

Software selection : I just install the OpenSSH server, in order to be
able connecting, but I don't install anything else since I want to use
the RSAT bash file with apt-get packages etc.
    -> ... Select and install software (takes some time)

Install the GRUB boot loader
	Yes

================================================================
Screen resolution (for the Desktop version)
================================================================

At first log in, screen resolution is restricted to 640x480 pixels. 

I found the solution here:

http://www.juanrubio.me/2014/02/ubuntu-trusty-virtualbox-guest-additions/

I run the following commands: 

  sudo bash
  apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
  software-properties-gtk --open-tab=4

In the dialog box, 
   - check the option "Using x86 Virtualization ..."
   - click "Apply changes" 
   - click "Close"
Reboot


================================================================
Login in in the VM
================================================================

At this tage, the machine is able to boot and get a dynamic IP from
the network. I login as rsat user and type
    ifconfig
to get the IP address. I then open a terminal on the host machine, and run
   ssh rsat@[IP_OF_MY_VM]
so I can run the rest of the installation in my familiar environment
(terminal, keyboard, ...)


ssh rsat[myvm]

## Transfer my screenrc preferences
rsync -ruptvl rsat@rsat.ulb.ac.be:.screenrc .

## Transfer RSAT ssh parameters + open an agent that will manage my
## password for future ssh communications.
rsync -ruptvl rsat@rsat.ulb.ac.be:.ssh .
ssh-agent > ~/agent
source ~/agent
ssh-add

================================================================
Network specification
================================================================

## I need emacs to edit the network configuration file
sudo bash
df -h
apt-get install  --quiet --assume-yes  emacs

## Since this is the first installation of an apt-get package, it
## takes some time to install dependencies.
df -h

emacs -nw /etc/network/interfaces

## I edit the file /etc/network/interfaces

## Host-only network interface for the VirtualBox VM
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.56.114
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.56.0
broadcast 192.168.56.255
gateway 192.168.56.1

## Let the second interface automatically ask an IP address to the
## DHCP server (this was by default the first interface eth0, but we
## want to impose the static address as first interface).
autho eth1
iface eth1 inet dhcp

## Re-activate the interface, this seems to be the best way withb ubuntu 14.04
ifdown eth1 ## Stop the eth1 interface
ifup eth1 ## Start the eth1 interface with its new configuration
ifconfig ## Check that eth1 is specified as expected

## This should display something like this
## ...
## eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 08:00:27:9e:3d:cd  
##           inet addr:192.168.56.114  Bcast:192.168.56.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
## ...


## We need to install the ssh package in order to enable connection
## from the host terminal
apt-get install --quiet --assume-yes ssh

## reboot
## (Note: I am not sure if we still need to reboot here, to be checked)

## We can now access the VM by ssh to its static IP address
ssh rsat@192.168.56.114

================================================================
Install ubuntu packages
================================================================

## cf script
##   $RSAT/doc/howto/install_rsat_ubuntu14.04.bash


================================================================
Useful commands to manage VirtualBox
================================================================

List running VMs
  VBoxManage list runningvms

Get the IDs of the virtual machines
  VBoxManage list runningvms | awk -F"[{}]" '{print $2}'

For convenience, we store the IP of the machine of interest in an
environment variable VMID.
  VMID=`VBoxManage list runningvms | awk -F"[{}]" '{print $2}'`

Get properties of the VM
  VBoxManage guestproperty enumerate ${VMID}

List information about a given virtual machine
  VBoxManage showvminfo ${VMID}

Note: that command fives the MAC address, but no IP address.
  VBoxManage showvminfo ${VMID} | grep '^NIC'

================================================================
Convenient settings (not necessary)
================================================================


1) Clipboard sharing between guest and host
-------------------------------------------
For the desktop version of Ubuntu, it is convenient to enable
copy-paste between the guest and the host.

- select the VM
- In the VirtualBox menu, select "Machine -> Settings"
- In panel "General", select the tab "Advanced".
     set "Shared clipboard" to "Bidirectional"

================================================================
Create a generic user for the virtual machine
================================================================


################################################################
## Create a user for the virtual machine
##
## This VM user is separate from the rsat user, which only serves to
## manage the RSAT software suite and related packages.
##
## For the sake of security, we force this user to change password at
## first login

## First delete this user (in case it was previously defined)
##  sudo userdel --remove vuser

sudo useradd --password `openssl passwd -1 -salt xyz tochng`\
    --home /home/vuser \
    --create-home \
    --shell /bin/bash \
    --comment "VM-user" \
    vuser

## Force vuser to change password at first login
sudo chage -d 0 vuser

## Add sudoer rights to vuser
sudo chmod 644 /etc/sudoers
sudo emacs -nw /etc/sudoers
## Find the following line
##     # User privilege specification
##     root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
## Below it, add the following line:
##     rsat  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
##     vuser  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL



================================================================
PROBLEMS TO BE FIXED
================================================================

1) Ethernet: optimize solution for a simple setting in the classroom.

2) Problem of disk occupancy: Ubuntu shared memory occupies 2Gb. This
   can be modified as explained here.
	http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/what-is-devshm-and-its-practical-usage.html

4) For the desktop version, I should try to use the "Advanced
   installation" in order to use less disk without loosing too much
   confort. For example, I could inactivate the support for all the
   languages that are installed by default (downloading language
   packs).
